# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the [online home](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) of *Geocomputation with R*, a forthcoming book with [CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER).

## Development {-}

Inspired by [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and other open source projects we are developing this book in the open.
Why?
To encourage contributions, ensure reproducibility and provide access to the material as it evolves.

The book's development can be divided into four main phases:

1. Foundations
2. Basic applications
3. Geocomputation methods
4. Advanced applications

Currently the focus is on Part 2, which we aim to be complete by December.
New chapters will be added to this website as the project progresses, hosted at [robinlovelace.net/geocompr](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr) and kept up-to-date thanks to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr).
Currently the build is:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr) 

The version of the book you are reading now was built on `r Sys.Date()` and was built `r if(is_on_travis) "on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Robinlovelace/geocompr)" else "locally"`.

## How to contribute? {-}

**bookdown** makes editing a book as easy as editing a wiki, provided you have a GitHub account ([sign-up at github.com](https://github.com/)).
Once logged-in to GitHub, clicking on the 'edit me' icon highlighted in the image below will take you to the source [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) where you can make changes:

To raise an issue about the book's content (e.g. code not running) or make a feature request, check-out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues).

## Reproducibility {-}

To reproduce the book, you need a recent version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and up-to-date packages, which can be installed with the following command (which requires [**devtools**](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)):

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=is_online}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/geocompr")
```

To build the book locally, clone or [download](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/archive/master.zip) the [geocompr repo](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/), load R in root directory (e.g. by opening [geocompr.Rproj](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/geocompr.Rproj) in RStudio) and run the following lines:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd") # to build the book
browseURL("_book/index.html") # to view it
```

# Preface {-}

This book is aimed at people who want to do spatial data analysis, visualization and modeling with a modern programming language (R).
There is no single target audience but we expect the book to be especially useful for:

- People who have learned spatial analysis skills using a desktop Geographic Information System (GIS) such as [QGIS](http://qgis.org/en/site/), [ArcMap](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/), [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) or [SAGA](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html), who want access to a powerful (geo)statistical and visualization programming language and the benefits of a command-line approach [@sherman_desktop_2008]:

> With the advent of 'modern' GIS software, most people want to point and click their way through life. Thatâ€™s good, but there is a tremendous amount of flexibility and power waiting for you with the command line.

- Graduate students and researchers from fields specializing in geographic data including Geography, Remote Sensing, Planning, GIS and Geographic Data Science
- Academics and post-graduate students working on projects in fields including Geology, Regional Science, Biology and Ecology, Agricultural Sciences (precision farming), Archaeology, Epidemiology, Transport Modeling, and broadly defined Data Science which require the power and flexibility of R for their research <!-- please add further fields-->
- Applied researchers and analysts in public, private or third-sector organisations who need the reproducibility, speed and flexibility of a command-line language such as R in applications dealing with spatial data as diverse as Urban and Transport Planning, Logistics, Geo-marketing (store location analysis) and Emergency Planning <!-- please add further examples-->

The book is designed to be accessible to a wide audience.
The chapters progress gradually in difficulty and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter to ensure understanding.
However, R novices may find the reproducible code chunks --- an integral part of the book --- difficult to understand and implement at first. 

Impatient readers are welcome to dive straight into the first practical examples in Chapter \@ref(spatial-class).
However we suggest most R beginners get up-to-speed with R before diving-in to chapters onwards (unless you're reading the book for an understanding of the concepts).
R has a supportive community that has developed a wealth of resources that can help here, three of which we highly recommend: [An introduction to R](http://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/) [@venables_introduction_2017],  [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@grolemund_r_2016] and [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/) [@gillespie_efficient_2016], especially [Chapter 2](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) (on installing and setting-up R/RStudio) and [Chapter 10](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/learning.html) (on learning to learn).
There are also many interactive resources, including DataCamp's [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) and tutorials created with [**learnr**](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/examples.html).

With such material to hand we are confident that the command-line approach demonstrated in this book will be worthwhile within a few months for most people, including programming novices.
Over time and with practice R will likely become the natural choice for many geographic applications.
We expect you will eventually find its interface faster than the point-and-click interface emphasized in many desktop GISs.
For some applications such as Spatial Statistics and modelling R may be the *only* realistic way to get the work done.

As outlined in section \@ref(why-geocomputation-with-r) there are many reasons for using R for geocomputation:
R is well-suited to the interactive use required in many geographic data analysis workflows compared with other languages.
R excels in the rapidly growing fields of Data Science (which includes data carpentry, statistical learning techniques and data visualization) and (via efficient interfaces to databases and distributed computing systems) Big Data.

For some applications another language may be more appropriate, such as Python, Java or C++.
There are excellent resources for learning geocomputation *without R*, as discussed in section \@ref(software-for-geocomputation).
However we advocate learning one language (R) in *depth* to gain an understanding of the concepts.
Proficiency with one programming language is preferable to the *breadth* of knowledge (and potential for confusion) attainable by dabbling with many.

We believe that *Geocomputation with R* will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to solve the majority of challenges that geographic data pose.
A logical question to ask if you've read this far may be: what *is* geocomputation anyway?
The answer is provided in section \@ref(what-is-geocomputation) which, alongside the rest of Chapter \@ref(intro), explains the motivations behind this book.

<!-- to think about, not sure if needed but then this would be a good place to point out why our book might have advantages over other books. Compare with:
- Bivand, R., Pebesma, E., Gomez-Rubio, V. (2013): Applied spatial data analysis with R.
- Blangiardo, M. & Cameletti, M. (2015): Spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian models with R - INLA.
- Brunsdon, C. & Comber, L. (2015): An introduction to R for spatial analysis and mapping.
- Dorman, M. (2014): Learning R for geospatial analysis.
- Hijmans, R. (2016): Spatial data analysis and modeling with R.  http://rspatial.org/intr/index.html (haven't read it but might be more suitable for beginners, however, it does not consider sf; additionally, it provides more code than text, and hence, probably less explanations than our book) 
- Quiang, S. (2016): Environmental and Ecological Statistics with R (not really a competitor, I have ordered a copy, this book is really about modeling, and I would rather prefer the Zuur et al. books over it)
- Wegmann, M., Leutner, B., Dech, S. (2016): Remote Sensing and GIS for ecologists: Using Open Source Software.
- Zuur, A., Ieno, E., Saveliev, A. (2017): Beginner's guide to spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal ecological data analysis with R-INLA.

Put the competing books into categories, e.g., introduction to spatial analysis (Brundsdon, Dorman, Hijmans), advanced spatial analysis (Bivand), topical spatial analysis (Quiang, Wegmann),  (mainly) spatial modeling (Bivand, Blangiardo, Hijmans, Quiang, Zuur).
Point out where our book fits in and which gap it is filling -> somewhere between advanced (but not that hard) and spatial modeling with a broad range of topics (not just one like ecology).
We try to address a broad audiecence with an interest in spatial data, and how things can be **get done**, not just theoretically but in an applied way.
On the other hand, we embed the shown methods into the bigger field of GIScience, provide context and refer to further literature for the interested reader.
