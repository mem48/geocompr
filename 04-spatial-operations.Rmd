# Spatial data operations

## Prerequisites {-}

- This chapter requires the packages **tidyverse**, **sf** and **raster**. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(raster)
```

- It also relies on **spData**, which loads datasets used in examples in the chapter:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(spData)
```

## Introduction

Spatial operations are a vital part of geocomputation.
This chapter shows how spatial objects can be modified in a multitude of ways based on their location and shape.
The content clearly builds on the previous chapter because many spatial operations have a non-spatial (attribute) equivalent.
Spatial operations on *vector* objects include spatial subsetting (covered in section \@ref(spatial-subsetting)), joining and aggregation (section \@ref(spatial-joining-and-aggregation)).
These topics may sound daunting, but they have already been covered, in section \@ref(vector-attribute-manipulation).
Spatial operations on *rasters* include merging and subsetting, covered in section \@ref(spatial-operations-on-raster-data).

The chapter also introduces new concepts that are unique to spatial data.
A variety of *topological relations* can be used to subset/join vector geometries (by default **sf** uses the catch-all *intersects* but other relations such as *within* can be very useful), a topic that is explored in section \@ref(topological-relations).
New geometry data can be created by modifying existing spatial objects, using operations such as 'buffer' and 'clip', described in sections \@ref(modifying-geometry-data) and \@ref(clipping).
Spatial operations on raster datasets involve *map algebra* (covered in sections \@ref(map-algebra) to \@ref(global-operations-and-distances)) and combining and aligning them (covered in sections \@ref(merging-rasters) and \@ref(aligning-rasters)).

Another unique aspect of spatial objects is distance.
All spatial objects are related through space and distance calculations can be used to find the strength of this relationship between spatial entities.
Distance operations are covered in sections \@ref(distance-relations) and \@ref(global-operations-and-distances) for vector and raster datasets respectively.

```{block2 type='rmdnote'}
It is important to note that spatial operations that use two spatial objects rely on both objects having the same coordinate reference system, a topic that was introduced in \@ref(crs-intro) and which will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6.
```

## Spatial operations on vector data

This section provides an overview of spatial operations in the **sf** package.

### Spatial subsetting

Spatial subsetting is the process of selecting features of a spatial object based on whether or not they in some way *relate* in space to another object.
An example of spatial subsetting is provided by the `nz` and `nz_height` datasets in **spData**, which provide projected data on the 16 main regions and 101 highest points in New Zealand (Figure \@ref(fig:nz-subset)).
The following code subsets all the high points in the Canterbury region:

```{r}
canterbury = nz %>% filter(REGC2017_NAME == "Canterbury Region")
canterbury_height = nz_height[canterbury, ]
```

```{r nz-subset, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of spatial subsetting. The right-hand map was produced by subsetting the point data in the left hand map as follows: `nz_height[canterbury, ]`."}
par_old = par()
par(mar=c(0, 0, 1, 0), mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(nz$geometry, col = "white", bgc = "lightblue", main = "High points in New Zealand")
plot(nz_height, add = TRUE, pch = 2, col = "red")
plot(nz$geometry, col = "white", bgc = "lightblue", main = "High points in Canterbury")
plot(canterbury$geometry, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(canterbury_height, add = TRUE, pch = 2, col = "red")
par(par_old)
```

The preceding code chunk shows that, like attribute data, spatial data can be subset using the `[` operator: `x[y, ]` subsets features of target object `x` by `y`.
Instead of `y` being of class `logical` (a vector of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values), it is another spatial (`sf`) object.

Various *topological relations*, which determine the type of spatial relationship used for subsetting, can be used for spatial subsetting.
As we'll see in section \@ref(topological-relations), these include features that *touch*, *cross* or are *within* the source object (`y`).
*Intersects* is the default for subsetting (and other spatial operations) however, because it is a useful 'catch all' that identifies all types of spatial relations.
Topological relations are best understood in the context of subsetting, explaining why this topic is covered in the next section.

For now the important thing to remember is that subsetting a spatial object `x` by another spatial object `y` returns any features in `x` that in some way relate (using the *intersects* operator) in space to `y`.
Other operators can be used using the `op =` argument.
The following code, for example, would select all points in `nz_height` that do *not* intersect with Canterbury (result not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nz_height[canterbury, , op = st_disjoint]
```

```{block2 type='rmdnote'}
Interested readers can see this default value of `op` set in the first line of the function call by entering its long-form name into the console `` sf:::`[.sf` ``.
The `?sf` help page documents this also.
```

In general terms, spatial subsetting is simply the spatial equivalent of *attribute subsetting*.
As with attribute subsetting, spatial subsetting is a *binary operation*: an object is either selected or not.
Following the structure of section \@ref(vector-attribute-subsetting), we start with base methods before describing how to do it in the **tidyverse**.
<!-- todo: link to non-binary links, e.g. area-weighted spatial interpolation -->

<!-- #### Spatial subsetting in base R -->

<!-- Another spatial subsetting example will use an object representing the countries of Africa, created using attribute subsetting as follows:^[Recall -->
<!-- attribute subsetting can also be done in base R with `africa_wgs = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]`.] -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- africa_wgs = world %>% filter(continent == "Africa") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To further prepare the input data, we will reproject the data to the coordinate reference system (CRS) 32630, its EPSG code (explained in Chapter 6): -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- africa = st_transform(africa_wgs, crs = 32630) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can also use the `[` operator for *Spatial* subsetting. -->
<!-- The difference is that we use *another spatial object* inside the square brackets instead of an `integer` or `logical` vector. -->
<!-- This is a concise and consistent syntax, as shown in the next code chunk. -->
<!-- Let's test it with a hypothetical scenario: we want to subset all countries within 2000 km of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:globe). -->
<!-- The subsetting object is created below. -->
<!-- Note that this must have the same CRS as the target object (set with the `crs` argument): -->

<!-- ```{r, warning=FALSE} -->
<!-- center_wgs = st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0)), crs = 4326)) -->
<!-- center = st_transform(center_wgs, 32630) -->
<!-- buff = st_buffer(center, dist = 2e6) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r globe, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subsetting scenario: which countries intersect with a circle of 2000 km in radius located at zero degrees longitude and zero degrees latitude? Figure created with the **[globe](https://cran.r-project.org/package=globe)** package."} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/globe.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The data to be subset, or 'target layer', is the `africa` object created above, which has a projected CRS (`32630`). -->
<!-- Subsequently, spatial subsetting can be done with a single, concise command: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- africa_buf = africa[buff, ] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{block2 type='rmdnote'} -->
<!-- If we were using geographic ('lon/lat') data the previous command would have emitted a message warning about assuming `planar coordinates`. -->
<!-- This is because spatial operations (especially distance and area calculations) cannot be assumed to be accurate in a geographic (longitude/latitude) CRS. -->
<!-- In this case one could justify the use of a lon/lat CRS: the data is close to the equator where there is least distortion caused by the curvature of the earth. -->
<!-- It is good practice to reproject spatial datasets before performing spatial operations on them. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The spatial subsetting clearly worked: only countries intersecting with the giant circle are returned (Figure \@ref(fig:africa-buff)): -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(africa_buf["pop"]) -->
<!-- plot(buff, add = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- Todo: improve this figure, e.g. by creating a new hidden chunk - still show this one -->
<!-- ```{r africa-buff, fig.cap="Subset of the `africa` data selected based on their intersection with a circle 2000 km in radius with a center point at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude.", echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(leaflet) -->
<!-- leaflet() %>%  -->
<!--   addProviderTiles("OpenMapSurfer.Grayscale") %>%  -->
<!--   addPolygons(data = st_transform(africa_buf, 4326)) %>%  -->
<!--   addPolygons(data = st_transform(buff, 4326), color = "red") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that countries that just touch the giant circle are selected such as Chad (northeast of the circle). -->
<!-- This is because the default subsetting operator is `st_intersects()`, which returns any type of spatial relation. -->
<!-- Other spatial subsetting operations such as `st_within()` are more conservative, as shown in section \@ref(topological-relations). -->

Before we progress to the next section, it is worth seeing how subsetting can be done using *topological operators* directly.
The result illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:nz-subset) can be reproduced using the operator `st_intersects()` as follows:

```{r}
sel = st_intersects(x = nz_height, y = canterbury, sparse = FALSE)
```

The third way is essentially the same as the second, but uses the `filter()` function introduced in section \@ref(vector-attribute-subsetting), forming the foundations of a 'tidy' spatial data analysis workflow.
If you already use **dplyr** for data manipulation, this way should seem familiar:

```{r}
# africa_buf3 = filter(africa, sel_buff)
```

How can we be sure that the results are the same for the three subsetting operations?
We can test them as follows:

```{r}
# identical(x = africa_buf, y = africa_buf2)
# identical(x = africa_buf, y = africa_buf3)
```

The reason that the third spatially subset object (`africa_buf3`) is not identical is that **dplyr** changes the row names:

```{r}
# head(row.names(africa_buf))
# head(row.names(africa_buf3))
```

If the row names are re-set, the objects become identical:

```{r}
# attr(africa_buf3, "row.names") = attr(x = africa_buf, "row.names")
# identical(africa_buf, africa_buf3)
```

```{block type='rmdnote'}
This discarding of row names is not something that is specific to spatial
data, as illustrated in the code chunk below.
**dplyr** discards row names by design.
For further discussion of this decision, and some controversy, see the (closed) issue [#366](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/366) in the package's issue tracker.
```

```{r}
# row.names(africa[africa$subregion == "Northern Africa", ])
# row.names(filter(africa, subregion == "Northern Africa"))
```

<!-- Subset (1) points in polygons <-> (2) -->

To understand topological relations, it helps to have some simple test data to work with.
Figure \@ref(fig:relation-objects) illustrates a polygon (`a`), a line (`l`) and some points (`p`).
These objects are created in the code below.

```{r}
a_poly = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-1, -1), c(1, -1), c(1, 1), c(-1, -1))))
a = st_sfc(a_poly)

l_line = st_linestring(x = matrix(c(-1, -1, -0.5, 1), , 2))
l = st_sfc(l_line)

p_matrix = matrix(c(0.5, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0.5, 1), ncol = 2)
p_multi = st_multipoint(x = p_matrix)
p = st_sf(st_cast(st_sfc(p_multi), "POINT"))
```

```{r relation-objects, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Points (p 1 to 4), line and polygon objects arranged to demonstrate spatial relations."}
plot(a, border = "red", col = "grey", axes = TRUE)
plot(l, add = TRUE)
plot(p, add = TRUE, lab = 1:4)
text(p_matrix[, 1] + 0.1, p_matrix[, 2] - 0.1, 1:4)
```

A simple query is: which of the points in `p` intersect in some way with polygon `a`?
The question can be answered by inspection (points 1 and 2 are over or touch the triangle).
It can also be answered by using the topological relation *intersects*, implemented in **sf** as follows:

```{r}
st_intersects(p, a)
```

The contents of the result should be as you expected:
the function returns a positive (`1`) result for the first two points, and a negative result (represented by an empty vector, `integer(0)`) for the last two.
What may be unexpected is that the result comes in the form of a list.
This is because topological operations in the **sf** return a sparse matrix by default, which is useful in that it reduces the memory requirements of the output from operations on multi-feature objects.
To return the result as a logical vector, of the type that can be used for subsetting and other operations, the result must be returned as a *dense matrix*.
This can be done by setting the `sparse` argument to `FALSE` as follows:

```{r}
st_intersects(p, a, sparse = FALSE)
```

The output is an matrix with the four rows representing the four features in the target object `p`.
The rows represent features in the selecting object: the first two features in `p` intersect with `a` (There is only one feature in `a` so the result has only one column).
The result can be used to subset the features of `p` in a two-stage operation that is equivalent of `p[a, ]`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sel = st_intersects(p, a, sparse = FALSE)[, 1]
p[sel, ]
```

Note the use of `[, 1]` to select only the first column --- we'll use this to return only a vector instead of matrix in subsequent code chunks.
This operator ensures that the intermediary object `sel` is a `logical` vector (rather than a matrix).

`st_intersects()` returns `TRUE` for the second feature in the object `p` even though it just touches the polygon `a`.
This is because *intersects* is a catch-all topological operation that covers any type of spatial relation.
There are many other topological operations that you can use, some of which we'll demonstrate below.
The opposite of `st_intersects()` is `st_disjoint()`, which returns only objects that do not spatially relate in any way to the selecting object:

```{r}
st_disjoint(p, a, sparse = FALSE)[, 1]
```

Other topological operators are more specific.
`st_within()`, for example, returns `TRUE` only for objects that are completely within the selecting object.
This applies only to the second object, which is inside the triangular polygon, as illustrated below:

```{r}
st_within(p, a, sparse = FALSE)[, 1]
```

Note that although point 1 is *within* the triangle, it does not *touch* any part of its border.
For this reason `st_touches()` only returns `TRUE` for the second point:

```{r}
st_touches(p, a, sparse = FALSE)[, 1]
```

What about features that do not touch, but *almost touch* the selection object?
These can be selected using `st_is_within_distance()`, which has an additional `dist` argument.
It can be used to set how close target object need to be before they are selected.
Note that although point 4 is one unit of distance from the nearest node of `a` (at point 2 in Figure \@ref(fig:relation-objects)), it is still selected when the distance is set to 0.9.
This is illustrated in the code chunk below, the second line of which converts the lengthy list output into a `logical` object:

```{r}
sel = st_is_within_distance(p, a, dist = 0.9) # can only return a sparse matrix
lengths(sel) > 0
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# other tests
st_overlaps(p, a, sparse = FALSE)
st_covers(p, a, sparse = FALSE)
st_covered_by(p, a, sparse = FALSE)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
st_contains(a, p[2, ], sparse = TRUE)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# starting simpler so commented
a1 = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-1, -1), c(1, -1), c(1, 1), c(-1, -1))))
a2 = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(2, 0), c(2, 2), c(3, 2), c(3, 0), c(2, 0))))
a = st_sfc(a1, a2)

b1 = a1 * 0.5
b2 = a2 * 0.4 + c(1, 0.5)
b = st_sfc(b1, b2)

l1 = st_linestring(x = matrix(c(0, 3, -1, 1), , 2))
l2 = st_linestring(x = matrix(c(-1, -1, -0.5, 1), , 2))
l = st_sfc(l1, l2)

p = st_multipoint(x = matrix(c(0.5, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0.5), , 2))

plot(a, border = "red", axes = TRUE)
plot(b, border = "green", add = TRUE)
plot(l, add = TRUE)
plot(p, add = TRUE)
```

### Spatial joining and aggregation 

Joining two non-spatial datasets relies on a shared 'key' variable, as described in section \@ref(vector-attribute-joining).
Spatial data joining applies the same concept, but instead relies on shared areas of geographic space.
As with attribute data joining adds a new column to the target object (the argument `x` in joining functions) from a source object (`y`).

The process is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-join), which shows a target object (the `world` dataset, left) being joined to a source dataset (the three most populous cities of the world), resulting in a new attribute being added to the `world` dataset (right).
<!-- Idea: use random points over Earth's surface to allocate data to world countries. -->
<!-- I'm not sure this is a good starting example to show how st_join works - thoughts? -->

```{r}
urb = urban_agglomerations %>% 
  filter(year == 2020) %>% 
  top_n(n = 3, wt = population_millions)
asia = world %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
joined = st_join(x = asia, y = urb) %>% 
  na.omit()
```


```{r spatial-join, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of a spatial join: the populations of the world's 3 largest agglomerations joined onto their respective countries.", fig.asp=0.4, warning=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(urb$geometry, col = "white", main = "Target object")
plot(asia$geom, add = TRUE)
plot(urb["population_millions"], pch = 15, main = "Source object (points)")
plot(joined$geom, border = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(urb["population_millions"], pch = 15, main = "Result of spatial join")
plot(joined["population_millions"], add = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

This operation is also know as spatial overlay.
By default, `st_join()` performs a left join (see section \@ref(vector-attribute-joining)), but it can also do inner joins by setting the argument `left = FALSE`.
Like spatial subsetting, the default topological operator used by `st_join()` is `st_intersects()`.
This can be changed with the `join` argument (see `?st_join` for details).
In the example above, we have added features of a point layer to a polygon layer but there might be multiple point matches per polygon. 
Had we chosen to select the four (instead of three) most populous cities in the world, two of them would have belonged to China (Shanghai and Beijing, give it a try yourself).
In such a case `st_join()` simply adds a new row.
In our example we would have ended up with two polygons representing China.

### Non-overlapping joins

Sometimes two geographic datasets do not touch but still have a strong geographic relationship enabling joins.
The datasets `cycle_hire` and `cycle_hire_osm`, already loaded in the **spData** package, provide a good example.
Plotting them shows that they are closely related but they do not touch, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cycle-hire), a base version of which is created with the following code below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(cycle_hire$geometry, col = "blue")
plot(cycle_hire_osm$geometry, add = T, pch = 3, col = "red")
```

We can check if any points are the same `st_intersects()` as show below:

```{r, message=FALSE}
any(st_touches(cycle_hire, cycle_hire_osm, sparse = FALSE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# included to show alternative ways of showing there's no overlap
sum(cycle_hire$geometry %in% cycle_hire_osm$geometry)
sum(st_coordinates(cycle_hire)[, 1] %in% st_coordinates(cycle_hire_osm)[, 1])
```

```{r cycle-hire, fig.cap="The spatial distribution of cycle hire points in London based on official data (blue) and OpenStreetMap data (red).", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tmap)
# osm_tiles = tmaptools::read_osm(tmaptools::bb(cycle_hire, ext = 1.3), type = "https://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/tiles/roadsg/x={x}&y={y}&z={z}")
# qtm(osm_tiles) +
  tm_shape(cycle_hire) +
  tm_bubbles(col = "blue", alpha = 0.5, size = 0.2) +
  tm_shape(cycle_hire_osm) +
  tm_bubbles(col = "red", alpha = 0.5, size = 0.2) +
  tm_scale_bar()
# library(leaflet)
# leaflet() %>%
#   addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>% 
#   addCircles(data = cycle_hire) %>% 
#   addCircles(data = cycle_hire_osm, col = "red") %>% 
#   mapview::mapshot(file = "cycle-hire.png")
# file.rename("cycle-hire.png", "figures/cycle-hire.png")
# knitr::include_graphics("figures/cycle-hire.png")
```

Imagine that we need to join the `capacity` variable in `cycle_hire_osm` onto the official 'target' data contained in `cycle_hire`.
This is when a non-overlapping join is needed.
The simplest method is to use the topological operator `st_within_distance()` shown in section \@ref(topological-relations).
Note that before performing the relation both datasets must be transformed into a projected CRS, saved as new objects denoted by the affix `P` (for projected) below, using a treshold distance of 20 m:

```{r}
x = st_transform(cycle_hire, 27700)
y = st_transform(cycle_hire_osm, 27700)
sel = st_is_within_distance(x, y, dist = 20)
summary(lengths(sel) > 0)
```

This shows that there are 436 points in the target object `cycle_hire` within the threshold distance.
How to retrieve the *values* associated with the respective `cycle_hire_osm` points though?
The solution is again with `st_join()` although the additional dist argument must be specified:

```{r}
z = st_join(x, y, st_is_within_distance, dist = 20)
nrow(cycle_hire)
nrow(z)
```

Note that the number of rows in the joined result is greater than the target.
This is because some cycle hire stations in `x` have multiple matches in `y`.
To aggregate the values for the overlapping points and return the mean, we can use the aggregation methods learned in Chapter 3, resulting in an object with the same number of rows as the target:

```{r}
z = z %>% group_by(id) %>% 
  summarize(capacity = mean(capacity))
nrow(z) == nrow(cycle_hire)
```

The capacity of nearby stations can be verified by comparing a plot of the capacity of the source `cycle_hire_osm` data with the results in this new object (plots not show):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(cycle_hire_osm["capacity"])
plot(z["capacity"])
```

<!-- Nearest neighbour analysis -->
<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (non-overlapping) -->
<!-- e.g. two point's datasets (overlapping) -->
<!-- ? topological problems of joining lines/polygons? -->
<!-- joining different types (e.g. points + polygons = geometry) -> save as GPKG? -->
<!-- `merge()`; `st_interpolate_aw()` -->


<!--### Modifying geometry data; still need to change the corresponding cross-references-->

The result of this join has used a spatial operation to change the attribute data associated with simple features but the geometry associated with each feature has remained unchanged.
In the subsequent sections, we will present spatial operations that also act on and modify the underlying geometry, namely aggregating (dissolving) and clipping operations.

### Dissolving and aggregating polygons

Like attribute data aggregation, covered in section \@ref(vector-attribute-aggregation), spatial data aggregation (also known as dissolving polygons) can be a way of *condensing* data.
Aggregated data show some statistic about a variable (typically mean average or total) in relation to some kind of *grouping variable*. 
For attribute data aggregation the grouping variable is another variable, typically one with few unique values relative to the number of rows.
The `REGION` variable in the `us_states` dataset is a good example:
there are only four subregions but 49 states (excluding Hawaii and Alaska).
In section \@ref(vector-attribute-aggregation) we have already seen how attribute aggregation process condensed the `world` dataset down into only eight rows.
Spatial data aggregation is the same conceptually but in addition to aggregating the attribute data, it dissolves the underlying polygons.
Here, we want to aggregate the state population into regions.
This means that we not only end up with four rows but also with four polygons (out of 49 in the beginning).
As with spatial subsetting, spatial aggregation operations work by extending existing functions, as illustrated in the code chunk below which aggregates US states to create the right hand map in Figure \@ref(fig:us-regions).

```{r}
regions = aggregate(x = us_states[, "total_pop_15"], by = list(us_states$REGION),
                    FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r us-regions, fig.cap="Spatial aggregation on contiguous polygons, illustrated by aggregating the population of US states into regions. Note the operation automatically dissolves boundaries between touching polygons in the same region.", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
old_par = par()
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(us_states[, "total_pop_15"], main = "US states")
plot(regions[, "total_pop_15"], main = "US regions")
par(old_par)
```

Spatial aggregation can also be done in the **tidyverse**, using **dplyr** functions as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
group_by(us_states, REGION) %>%
  summarize(sum(pop = total_pop_15, na.rm = TRUE))
```

<!--Not sure how to elegantly include your circle buffer intersection example -->


```{r}
# buff_agg = aggregate(x = africa[, "pop"], by = buff, FUN = sum)
```
<!--
show also tidyverse way, so what you are doing is basically a spatial join and a subsequent aggregation without a grouping variable. Didactically, it might be better to present a grouping variable.
-->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# st_join(buff, africa[, "pop"]) %>%
#   summarize(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
# summarize(africa[buff, "pop"], pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The result, `buff_agg`, is a spatial object with the same geometry as `by` (the circular buffer in this case) but with an additional variable, `pop` reporting summary statistics for all features in `x` that intersect with `by` (the total population of the countries that touch the buffer in this case).
Plotting the result (with `plot(buff_agg)`) shows that the operation does not really make sense:
Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) shows a population of over half a billion people mostly located in a giant circle floating off the west coast of Africa!  

```{r buff-agg, fig.cap="Result of spatial aggregation showing the total population of countries that intersect with a large circle whose center lies at 0 degrees longitude and latitude.", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# library(tmap)
# pal = tmaptools::get_brewer_pal(palette = "BuPu", n = 4, plot = F)
# breaks = c(0, 1e7, 1e8, 5e8, 1e9)
# bb_buff = tmaptools::bb(buff_agg, ext = 1.5)
# qtm(buff_agg, fill = pal[4], bbox = bb_buff) +
#   tm_shape(africa_buf) +
#   tm_fill("pop", palette = pal, breaks = breaks) +
#   tm_borders() +
#   qtm(africa[st_disjoint(africa, buff, sparse = FALSE), ]) +
#   tm_shape(buff) +
#   tm_borders(lwd = 3, lty = 3) +
#   tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"))
# detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The results of the spatial aggregation exercise presented in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg) are unrealistic for three reasons:

- People do not live in the sea (the geometry of the aggregating object is not appropriate for the geometry target object).
- This method would 'double count' countries whose borders cross aggregating polygons when multiple, spatially contiguous, features are used as the aggregating object.
- It is wrong to assume that all the people living in countries that *touch* the buffer reside *within* it (the default spatial operator `st_intersects()` is too 'greedy'). The most extreme example of this is Algeria, the most northerly country selected:
the spatial aggregation operation assumes that all 39 million Algerian citizens reside in the tiny southerly tip that is within the circular buffer.

A number of methods can be used to overcome these issues, and generate a more realistic population attributed to the circular buffer illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:buff-agg).
The simplest of these is to convert the country polygons into points representing their *geographic centroids* before aggregation, covered in section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data).
<!-- Todo: reference section where we demonstrate geographic centroid generation -->
This would ensure that any spatially contiguous aggregating object covering the target object (the Earth in this case) would result in the same total: there would be no double counting.
The estimated total population residing within the study area would be more realistic if geographic centroids were used.
(The centroid of Algeria, for example, is far outside the aggregating buffer.)

Except in cases where the number of target features per aggregating feature is very large, or where the aggregating object is *spatially congruent* with the target (covered in section \@ref(spatial-congruence-and-areal-interpolation)), using centroids can also lead to errors due to boundary effects:
imagine a buffer that covers a large area but contains no centroids.
These issues can be tackled when aggregating areal target data with areal interpolation.

#### Spatial congruence and areal interpolation

Spatial congruence is an important concept related to spatial aggregation.
An *aggregating object* object (which we will refer to as `y`, representing the buffer object in the previous section) is *congruent* with the target object (`x`, representing the countries in the previous section) if the two objects have shared borders.
Often this is the case for administrative boundary data, whereby the larger units (e.g., Middle Layer Super Output Areas in the UK or districts in many other European countries) are composed of many smaller units (Output Areas in this case, see [ons.gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) for further details or municipalities in many other European countries).

*Incongruent* aggregating objects, by contrast, do not share common borders with the target [@qiu_development_2012].
This is problematic for spatial aggregation (and other spatial operations) illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:areal-example).
Areal interpolation can help to alleviate this issue.
It helps to transfer data from one set of areal units to another.
A number of algorithms have been developed for areal interpolation, including area weighted and pycnophylactic interpolation methods task [@tobler_smooth_1979].

```{r areal-example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Illustration of congruent (left) and incongruent (right) areal units.", warning=FALSE, fig.asp=0.4}
rx = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 4, nrow = 4)))
ry = st_as_sf(raster::rasterToPolygons(raster::raster(ncol = 2, nrow = 2)))
rxo = st_as_sf(st_set_geometry(rx, NULL), geometry = rx$geometry + 15)
st_crs(rx) = NA
rx = rbind(rx, rxo)
set.seed(1985)
rx$value = rep(runif(nrow(rx) / 2), 2)
rx$layer = rep(c("Congruent", "Incongruent"), each = nrow(rxo))
library(tmap)
qtm(rx, "value") + tm_facets(by = "layer", drop.units = TRUE, ncol = 2) +
    tm_shape(ry) +
  tm_borders(lwd = 10) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE)
detach("package:tmap", unload = TRUE)
```

The simplest useful method for spatial interpolation is *area weighted* spatial interpolation.
This is implemented in `st_interpolate_aw()`, as demonstrated below:
<!-- well, what you are doing here is weighting the inhabitants presumably on the basis of the area. The link between your congruent and incongruent example is somehow missing. One gets the impression, that the spatial interpolation takes care of incongruencies which is not the case. So I would suggest to clarify the weighting procedure.-->

```{r}
# buff_agg_aw = st_interpolate_aw(x = africa["pop"], to = buff, extensive = TRUE)
```

Instead of simply aggregating, this procedure additionally applies a weight, in this case simply the area.
For instance, if the intersection of our buffer and a country is 100 000 km^^2^^ but the country has 1 mio square kilometers and 1 mio inhabitants, our result will obtain just a tenth of total population, in this case 100 000 inhabitants.

### Modifying geometry data

### Clipping

Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the `geometry` columns of at least some of the affected features.

Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: 
lines, polygons and their 'multi' equivalents.
To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example:
two overlapping circles with a centerpoint 1 unit away from each other and radius of 1:

```{r points, fig.cap="Overlapping circles."}
b = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points
b = st_buffer(b, dist = 1) # convert points to circles
l = c("x", "y")
plot(b)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) # add text
```

Imagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both `x` *and* `y`.
This can be done using the function `st_intersection()`, illustrated using objects named `x` and `y` which represent the left and right-hand circles:

```{r}
x = b[1]
y = b[2]
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE) # color intersecting area
```

The subsequent code chunk demonstrate how this works for all combinations of the 'Venn' diagram representing `x` and `y`, inspired by [Figure 5.1](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators) of the book R for Data Science [@grolemund_r_2016].
<!-- Todo: reference r4ds -->

```{r venn-clip, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Spatial equivalents of logical operators."}
par(mfrow = c(3, 3), mai = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
plot(b)
y_not_x = st_difference(y, x)
plot(y_not_x, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(y, x)")
plot(b)
plot(x, add = TRUE, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "x")
plot(b, add = TRUE)
x_or_y = st_union(x, y)
plot(x_or_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_union(x, y)")
x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y)
plot(b)
plot(x_and_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE) 
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_intersection(x, y)")
# x_xor_y = st_difference(x_xor_y, x_and_y) # failing
x_not_y = st_difference(x, y)
x_xor_y = st_sym_difference(x, y)
plot(x_xor_y, col = "grey")
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_sym_difference(x, y)")
plot.new()
plot(b)
plot(x_not_y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "st_difference(x, y)")
plot(b)
plot(y, col = "grey", add = TRUE)
plot(b, add = TRUE)
text(x = 0.5, y = 1, "y")
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

To illustrate the relationship between subsetting and clipping spatial data, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles `x` and `y` in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip).
Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both and some will be inside neither.
To generate the points will use a function not yet covered in this book, `st_sample()`.

There are two different ways to subset points that fit into combinations of the circles: via clipping and logical operators.
But first we must generate some points.
We will use the *simple random* sampling strategy to sample from a box representing the extent of `x` and `y`, using the code below to generate the situation plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-subset):

```{r venn-subset, fig.cap="Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y."}
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmat = matrix(c(bb[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2)]), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
box = st_polygon(list(pmat))
set.seed(2017)
p = st_sample(x = box, size = 10)
plot(box)
plot(x, add = TRUE)
plot(y, add = TRUE)
plot(p, add = TRUE)
text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# An alternative way to sample from the bb
bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y))
pmulti = st_multipoint(pmat)
box = st_convex_hull(pmulti)
```

### Distance relations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_distance(a, b)
```

## Spatial operations on raster data

This section builds on \@ref(manipulating-raster-objects), which highlights various basic methods for manipulating raster datasets, to demonstrate more advanced and explicitly spatial raster operations,
and uses the same object `elev` and `grain`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("code/create-rasters.R")
```

### Spatial subsetting {#raster-subsetting}

In the previous chapter (section \@ref(manipulating-raster-objects)) we have already learned how to subset raster datasets using cell IDs and matrix indexing.
Naturally, we can subset rasters also with the help of coordinates and spatial objects.
To use coordinates for subsetting, we have to 'translate' them into the corresponding cell ID(s) or by using the `extract()` command.
This operation is also known as extracting values/attributes to points.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# point within the top left pixel
elev[cellFromXY(elev, xy = c(-1.5, 1.5))]
# the same as
extract(elev, data.frame(x = -1.5, y = 1.5))
```

The `cellFromXY()` and the `extract()` command accept also a `SpatialPoints` or `SpatialPointsDataFrame` object (though not an **sf** object).
We can also use a raster object to subset another raster object (Figure \@ref(fig:raster-subset) left panel).

```{r}
clip = raster(nrow = 3, ncol = 3, res = 0.3, xmn = 0.9, xmx = 1.8, 
              ymn = -0.45, ymx = 0.45, vals = rep(1, 9))
elev[clip]
# we can also use extract
# extract(elev, extent(clip))
```

Basically, this amounts to retrieving the values of the first raster (here: `elev`) falling within the extent of a second raster (here: `clip`).
To retrieve a spatial output, we can tell R to keep the matrix structure.
This will return the two output values as a raster object.

```{r}
elev[clip, drop = FALSE]
```

For the same operation we can also use the `intersect()` and `crop()` command.

```{r raster-subset, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Subsetting raster values with the help of another raster (left). Raster mask (middle). Output of masking a raster."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/04_raster_subset.png")
```

Frequently, however, we have two rasters with the same extent and resolution where one raster object serves as a mask (Figure \@ref(fig:raster-subset) middle and right panel).
In these cases `intersect()` and `crop()` are of little use.
Instead we can use the `[` again or the `mask()` and `overlay()` commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rmask = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, 
               xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5,
               vals = sample(c(FALSE, TRUE), 36, replace = TRUE))
elev[rmask, drop = FALSE]
# using the mask command
mask(elev, rmask, maskvalue = TRUE)
# using overlay
# first we replace FALSE by NA
rmask[rmask == FALSE] = NA
# then we retrieve the maximum values
overlay(elev, rmask, fun = "max")
```

In the code chunk above, we have created a mask object called `rmask` randomly setting its values to `FALSE` and `TRUE`.
Next we only want to keep those values of `elev` which are `TRUE` in `rmask`, or expressed differently, we want to mask `elev` with `rmask`.
These operations are in fact Boolean local operations since we compare cell-wise two rasters.
The next subsection explores these and related operations in more detail.

### Map algebra

Map algebra makes raster processing really fast.
This is because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates.
To derive the coordinate of a specific cell, we have to calculate it using its matrix position and the raster resolution and origin.
For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing (one-to-one locational correspondence).
Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and the resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing.
This is exactly what map algebra is doing.
First, it checks the headers of the rasters on which to perform any algebraic operation, and only if they correspondent to each other, the processing goes on.
And secondly, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence.
This is where it substantially differs from matrix algebra which changes positions when for example multiplying or dividing matrices.

Map algebra (or cartographic modeling) divides raster operations into four subclasses [@tomlin_geographic_1990], with each of them either working on one or several grids simultaneously:

1. *Local* or per-cell operations.
2. *Focal* or neighborhood operations.
Most often the output cell value is the result of a 3 x 3 input cell block.
3. *Zonal* operations are similar to focal operations but instead of a predefined neighborhood, classes, which can take on any, i.e., also an irregular size and shape, are the basis for calculations.
4. *Global* or per-raster operations, that means the output cell derives its value potentially from one or several entire rasters

This classification scheme uses basically the number of cells involved in a processing step as distinguishing feature.
Raster operations can also be classified by discipline, for example terrain, hydrological analysis or image classifications.
The following sections explain how each type of map algebra operations can be used, with reference to worked examples (also see `vignette("Raster")` for a technical description of map algebra).

### Local operations

**Local** operations comprise all cell-by-cell operations in one or several layers.
A good example is the classification of intervals of numeric values into groups such as grouping a digital elevation model into low (class 1), middle (class 2) and high elevations (class 3).
Using the `reclassify()` command, we need first to construct a reclassification matrix, where the first column corresponds to the lower and the second column to the upper end of the class.
The third column represents the new value for the specified ranges in column one and two.
Here, we assign the raster values in the ranges 0--12, 12--24 and 24--36 are *reclassified* to take values 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rcl = matrix(c(0, 12, 1, 12, 24, 2, 24, 36, 3), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
recl = reclassify(elev, rcl = rcl)
```

Raster algebra is another classical use case of local operations.
This includes adding, subtracting and squaring two rasters.
Raster algebra also allows logical operations such as finding all raster cells that are greater than a specific value (5 in our example below).
The **raster** package supports all these operations and more, as described in `vignette("Raster")` and demonstrated below (results not show):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
elev + elev
elev^2
log(elev)
elev > 5
```

Instead of arithmetic operators, one can also use the `calc()` and `overlay()` functions.
These functions are more efficient, hence, they are preferable in the presence of large raster datasets. 
Additionally, they allow to directly store an output file.

The calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the most famous local, i.e. pixel-by-pixel, raster operations.
It ranges between - 1 and 1 with positive values indicating the presence of living plants (mostly > 0.2).
To calculate the NDVI, one uses the red and near-infrared bands of remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel imagery) exploiting the fact that vegetation absorbs light heavily in the visible light spectrum, and especially in the red channel, while reflecting it in the near-infrared spectrum.

$$
\begin{split}
NDVI&= \frac{\text{NIR} - \text{Red}}{\text{NIR} + \text{Red}}\\
\end{split}
$$
where NIR = near infrared channel
      Red = red channel

Predictive mapping is another interesting application of local raster operations.
The response variable correspond to measured or observed points in space, for example, species richness, the presence of landslides, tree disease or crop yield.
Consequently, we can easily retrieve space- or airborne predictor variables from various rasters (elevation, pH, precipitation, temperature, landcover, soil class, etc.).
Subsequently, we model our response as a function of our predictors using `lm`, `glm`, `gam` or a machine-learning technique. 
To make a spatial prediction, all we have to do, is to apply the estimated coefficients to the predictor rasters, and summing up the resulting output rasters (<!--Chapter ??; -->see also @muenchow_predictive_2013).
<!-- add reference to chapter ecological modeling -->

### Focal operations

While local functions operate on one cell, though possibly from multiple layers, **focal** operations take into account a central cell and its neighbors.
The neighborhood (also named kernel, filter or moving window) under consideration is typically of size 3-by-3 cells (that is the central cell and its eight surrounding neighbors) but can take on any other (not necessarily rectangular) shape as defined by the user.
A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood, uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell (Figure \@ref(fig:focal-example)).
Other names for this operation are spatial filtering and convolution [@burrough_principles_2015].

In R, we can use the `focal()` function to perform spatial filtering. 
We define the shape of the moving window with a `matrix` whose values correspond to weights (see `w` parameter in the code chunk below).
Secondly, the `fun` parameter lets us specify the function we wish to apply to this neighborhood.
Here, we choose the minimum, but any other summary function, including `sum()`, `mean()`, or `var()` can be used.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
r_focal = focal(elev, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = min)
```

```{r focal-example, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Input raster (left) and resulting output raster (right) due to a focal operation - summing up 3-by-3 windows."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/04_focal_example.png")
```

We can quickly check if the output meets our expectations.
In our example, the minimum value has to be always the upper left corner of the moving window (remember we have created the input raster by rowwise incrementing the cell values by one starting at the upper left corner).
In this example, the weighting matrix consists only of 1s, meaning each cell has the same weight on the output, but this can be changed.

Focal functions or filters play a dominant role in image processing.
Low-pass or smoothing filters use the mean function to remove extremes.
In the case of categorical data, we can replace the mean with the mode, which is the most common value.
By contrast, high-pass filters accentuate features.
The line detection Laplace and Sobel filters might serve as an example here.
Check the `focal()` help page how to use them in R.

Also, terrain processing uses heavily focal functions.
Think, for instance, of the calculation of the slope, aspect and flow directions.
The `terrain()` function lets you compute a few of these terrain characteristics but has not implemented all popular methods
For example, the Zevenbergen and Thorne method to compute the slope is missing.
Equally, many other terrain and GIS functions are **not** implemented in R such as curvatures, contributing areas, different wetness indexes, and many more.
Fortunately, desktop GIS commonly provide these algorithms.
In Chapter 13 we will learn how to access GIS functionality from within R.
<!-- Reference 13-gis chapter -->

### Zonal operations

*Zonal* operations are similar to focal operations.
The difference is that zonal filters can take on any shape instead of just a predefined window.
Our grain size raster is a good example (Figure \@ref(fig:cont-cate-rasters)) because the different grain sizes are spread in an irregular fashion throughout the raster.

To find the mean elevation for each grain size class, we can use the `zonal()` command.
This kind of operation is also known as *zonal statistics* in the GIS world. 

```{r}
z = zonal(elev, grain, fun = "mean") %>%
  as.data.frame
z
```

This returns the statistics for each category, here the mean altitude for each grain size class and can be added to the attribute table of the ratified raster (see previous chapter).

### Global operations and distances

*Global* operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone.
The most common global operations are descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset such as the minimum or maximum (see previous chapter).
Aside from that, global operations are also useful for the computation of distance and weight rasters.
In the first case, one can calculate the distance from each cell to a specific target cell.
For example, one might want to compute the distance to the nearest coast (see also `raster::distance()`).
We might also want to consider topography, that means, we are not only interested in the pure distance but would like also to avoid the crossing of mountain ranges when going to the coast.
To do so, we can weight the distance with elevation so that each additional altitudinal meter 'prolongs' the euclidean distance.
Visibility and viewshed computations also belong to the family of global operations <!--(in the exercises of Chapter ?? you will compute a viewshed raster)-->.
<!-- reference 13-gis chapter-->

Many map algebra operations have a counterpart in vector processing [@liu_essential_2009].
Computing a distance raster (zonal operation) while only considering a maximum distance (logical focal operation) is the equivalent to a vector buffer operation (section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data)).
Reclassifying raster data (either local or zonal function depending on the input) is equivalent to dissolving vector data (section \@ref(spatial-joining-and-aggregation)). 
Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains `NULL` or `NA` values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (section \@ref(modifying-geometry-data)).
Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (section \@ref(spatial-subsetting)). 
The difference is that two these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area (see Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip) for an example).
However, be careful with the wording.
Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for raster and vector data models.
Aggregating in the case of vector data refers to dissolving polygons while it means increasing the resolution in the case of raster data.
In fact, one could see dissolving or aggregating polygons as decreasing the resolution. 
However, zonal operations might be the better raster equivalent compared to changing the cell resolution. 
Zonal operations can dissolve the cells of one raster in accordance with the zones (categories) of another raster using an aggregation function (see above).

### Merging rasters
Suppose we would like to compute the NDVI (see section \@ref(local-operations)), and additionally want to compute terrain attributes from elevation data for observations within a study area.
Before such computations we would have to acquire airborne or remotely sensed information.
The corresponding imagery is often divided into scenes covering a specific spatial extent.
Frequently, a study area covers more than one scene.
In these cases we would like to merge the scenes covered by our study area. 
In the easiest case, we can just merge these scenes, that is put them side to side.
This is possible with digital elevation data (SRTM, ASTER).
In the following code chunk we first download the SRTM elevation data for Austria and Switzerland (for the country codes have a look at `ccodes()`).
In a second step, we merge the two rasters into one.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
aut = getData("alt", country = "AUT", mask = TRUE)
ch = getData("alt", country = "CHE", mask = TRUE)
aut_ch = merge(aut, ch)
```

**Raster**'s `merge()` command combines two images, and in case they overlap, it uses the value of the first raster.
You can do exactly the same with `gdalUtils::mosaic_rasters()` which is faster, and therefore recommended if you have to merge a multitude of large rasters stored on disk.

The merging approach is of little use when the overlapping values do not correspond to each other.
This is frequently the case when you want to combine spectral imagery from scenes that were taken on different dates.
The `merge()` command will still work but you will see a clear border in the resulting image.
The `mosaic()` command lets you define a function for the overlapping area. 
For instance, we could compute the mean value. 
This might smooth the clear border in the merged result but it will most likely not make it disappear.
To do so, we need a more advanced approach. 
Remote scientist frequently apply histogram matching or use regression techniques to align the values of the first image with those of the second image.
The packages **landsat** (`histmatch()`, `relnorm()`, `PIF()`), **satellite** (`calcHistMatch()`) and **RStoolbox** (`histMatch()`, `pifMatch()`) provide the corresponding functions.


### Aligning rasters

When merging or performing map algebra on rasters, their resolution, projection, origin and/or extent has to match.
Otherwise, how should we add the values of one raster with a resolution of 0.2 decimal degrees to a second with a resolution of 1 decimal degree?
The same problem arises when we would like to merge satellite imagery from different sensors with different projections and resolutions.
We can deal with such mismatches by aligning the rasters.

The `projectRaster()` function reprojects one raster to a desired projection, say from UTM to WGS84.
Equally, map algebra operations require the same extent.
Following code adds one row and two columns to each side of the raster while setting all new values to an elevation of 1000 meters (\@ref(fig:extend-example)).

```{r extend-example, fig.cap = "Original raster extended by 1 one row on each side (top, bottom) and two columns on each side (right, left)."}
elev_2 = extend(elev, c(1, 2), value = 1000)
plot(elev_2)
```

Performing an algebraic operation on two objects with differing extents in R, the **raster** package returns the result for the intersection, and says so in a warning.

```{r}
elev_3 = elev + elev_2
```

However, we can also align the extent of two rasters with the `extend()` command.
Here, we extend the `elev` object to the extend of `elev_2`. 
The newly added rows and column receive the default value of the `value` parameter, i.e., `NA`.

```{r}
elev_4 = extend(elev, elev_2)
```

The `aggregate()` and `disaggregate()` functions help to change the cell size resolution of a raster.
For instance, let us aggregate `elev` from a resolution of 0.5 to a resolution of 1, that means we aggregate by a factor of 2 (Fig. \@ref(fig:aggregate-example)).
Additionally, the output cell value should correspond to the mean of the input cells (but  one could use other functions as well such as `median()`, `sum()`, etc.):

```{r aggregate-example, fig.cap = "Original raster (left). Aggregated raster (right)."}
elev_agg = aggregate(elev, fact = 2, fun = mean)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(elev)
plot(elev_agg)
```

Note that the origin of `elev_agg` has changed, too.

```{r}
origin(elev)
origin(elev_agg)
```

The origin is the point closest to (0, 0) if you moved towards it in steps of x and y resolution.
If two rasters have different origins, their cells do not overlap completely which would make map algebra impossible.
To change the origin , use `origin()`.^[If the origins of two raster datasets are just marginally apart, it sometimes is sufficient to simply increase the `tolerance` argument  of `raster::rasterOptions()`.]
Looking at figure \@ref(fig:origin-example) reveals the effect of changing the origin.

```{r origin-example, fig.cap = "Plotting rasters with the same values but different origins."}
# plot the aggregated raster
plot(elev_agg)
# change the origin
origin(elev_agg) = c(0, 0)
# plot it again
plot(elev_agg, add = TRUE)
```


The `resample()` command lets you align several raster properties in one go, namely origin, extent and resolution.
Let us resample an extended `elev_agg` to the properties of `elev` again.

```{r}
# add 2 rows and columns, i.e. change the extent
elev_agg = extend(elev_agg, 2)
elev_disagg = resample(elev_agg, elev)
```

Though our disaggregated `elev_disagg` retrieved back its original resolution, cell size and extent, its values differ. 
However, this is to be expected, disaggregating **cannot** predict values at a finer resolution, it simply uses an interpolation algorithm.
It is important to keep in mind that disaggregating results in a finer resolution, the corresponding values, however, are only as accurate as their lower resolution source.

Finally, if you want to align many (possibly hundreds or thousands of) images stored on disk, you might want to checkout the `gdalUtils::align_rasters()` function.
Nevertheless, you may also use **raster** with very large datasets. 
This is because **raster**:

1. lets you work with raster datasets that are too large to fit into the main memory (RAM) by only processing chunks of it.
2. tries to fascilitate parallel processing.
For more information have a look at the help pages of `beginCluster()` and `clusteR()`.
Additionally, check out the *Multi-core functions* section in `vignette("functions", package = "raster")`.

<!-- ## Spatial data creation -->

<!-- where should "area" example be? in this or the previous chapter? -->
<!-- Not here - I think this chapter should focus on geomtry data -->
<!-- `st_centroid()` -->
<!-- `st_buffer()` -->
<!-- http://r-spatial.org//r/2017/06/09/mapedit_0-2-0.html -->

<!-- Commented out - think this would be better in c3 (RL) -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # add a new column -->
<!-- africa$area = set_units(st_area(africa), value = km^2) -->
<!-- africa$pop_density = africa$pop / africa$area -->

<!-- # OR -->
<!-- africa = africa %>% -->
<!--         mutate(area = set_units(st_area(.), value = km^2)) %>% -->
<!--         mutate(pop_density = pop / area) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that this has created a attributes for the area and population density variables: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- attributes(africa$area) -->
<!-- attributes(africa$pop_density) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- These can be set to `NULL` as follows: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- attributes(africa$area) = NULL -->
<!-- attributes(africa$pop_density) = NULL -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- changes classes; polygonize, etc-->

## Exercises

1. Write code that subsets points that are contained within `x` *and* `y` (illustrated by the plot in the 2^nd^ row and the 1^st^ column in Figure \@ref(fig:venn-clip)).
    - Create a randomly located point with the command `st_point()` (refer back to section \@ref(sfg) to see how to create spatial data 'from scratch').
2. Write code that uses functions `aggregate()` and `st_buffer()` to answers the following question: What proportion of the world's population lives in countries that intersect a circle with a 10 degree radius of the intersection between the equator and the [9^th^ meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_meridian_east)? (Advanced challenge: find the point with the highest number of people within a 10 degree radius.)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
center9 = st_sf(st_sfc(st_point(c(-9, 0)), crs = 4326))
buff9 = st_buffer(center9, dist = 10)
agg9 = aggregate(world["pop"], buff9, FUN = sum)
agg9$pop / sum(world$pop, na.rm = TRUE)
```

3. Assuming that people are evenly distributed across countries, estimate the population living *within* the circle created to answer the previous question.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
interp9 = st_interpolate_aw(x = world["pop"], to = buff9, extensive = TRUE)
```

4. Use `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")`, and reclassify the elevation in three classes: low, middle and high.
Secondly, compute the NDVI (`data(ndvi, package = "RQGIS")`) and the mean elevation for each altitudinal class.
5. Apply a line detection filter to `data(dem, package = "RQGIS")`.
6. Calculate the NDVI of a Landsat image. 
Use the Landsat image provided by the **spDataLarge** package (`system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package="spDataLarge")`).
7. This [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35555709/global-raster-of-geographic-distances) shows how to compute distances to the nearest coastline using `raster::distance()`.
Retrieve a digital elevation model of Spain, and compute a raster which represents the distance to the coast.
(Hint: Have a look at `getData()` to retrieve a digital elevation model and administrative boundaries for Spain.)
Before, computing the distance raster, you might want to increase the resolution of the input dem raster, otherwise computing time might become too long. 
Secondly, weight the distance raster with elevation.
Every 100 altitudinal meters should increase the distance to the coast by 10 km.
Finally, compute the difference between the raster using the euclidean distance and the raster weighted by elevation.
(Note that this is a very simple weighting approach.
A more advanced approach might instead weight by flow direction, i.e. favor the steepest drop or the slightest increase in elevation.)
