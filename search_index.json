["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 What is geocomputation? 1.2 Why Geocomputation with R? 1.3 Software for geocomputation 1.4 R’s spatial ecosystem 1.5 R’s spatial history 1.6 Exercises", " 1 Introduction This book is about harnessing the power of modern computers to do things with geographic data. It teaches a range of spatial skills, including: reading, writing and manipulating geographic data; making static and interactive maps; and modeling geographic phenomena. By demonstrating how various spatial operations can be linked, in the reproducible ‘code chunks’ that intersperse the prose, the book also shows how these skills support a transparent and thus scientific workflow. Learning how to use the wealth of geospatial ‘tools’ this computational approach enables can be exciting and liberating. However, it is even more liberating to create new tools. By the end of the book you should be able to create new tools in the form of shareable R functions. Over the last few decades a huge amount of work has gone into developing open source software for handling geographic data (see foss4g.org). This means that spatial data analysis is no longer the preserve of those who can afford expensive programs, and the hardware to run them. Anyone can now download high performance spatial libraries on their computer. However, despite the growth of geospatial software that is open source, much of it remains inaccessible, in a form that is scriptable and therefore easily reproducible and ‘computational’. Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as QGIS (see qgis.org) have greatly reduced the ‘barrier to entry’, but the emphasis of such programs on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) can discourage reproducibility and an emphasis on the code that the Geocomputational approach requires, as discussed in Chapter 13. A major aim of this book is to make geographic data analysis more accessible as part of a reproducible workflow. R is a flexible language that allows access to many spatial software libraries (see section 1.2). Before going into the details of the software, however, it is worth taking a step back and thinking about what we mean by geocomputation. 1.1 What is geocomputation? Geocomputation is a relatively young field with a ~30 year history, dating back to the first conference on the subject in 1996.1 What distinguishes geocomputation from the older quantitative geography, is its emphasis on “creative and experimental” GIS applications (Longley et al. 1998). Additionally, it is also about developing new, research-driven methods (Openshaw and Abrahart 2000): GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a ‘scientific’ approach. But geocomputation and this book teach more than just methods and code: they are about doing “practical work that is beneficial or useful” (Openshaw and Abrahart 2000). Of course, reading this book will give you a solid knowledge of geocomputational methods, and how to use them via the reproducible examples implemented in the code chunks in each chapter. But there is much more. This book aims to teach how to do geocomputation rather than just to think about it. Hence, you should be also able to apply the learned methods and mastered skills to real-world data, for evidence-based analysis in your own areas of interest. Moreover, throughout the book we encourage you to make geographic research more reproducible, scientific and socially beneficial. This book is also part of the movement towards Geographical Information Science (GDS), a more recent concept which incorporates elements of ‘data science’ into GIS. Like Geocomputation, GSD can be defined in terms of its relation with GIS, some of which are outlined in Table 1.1. The focus on reproducibility and a command-line interface in this book is aligned with GDS. Table 1.1: Differences in emphasis between the fields of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Geographic Data Science (GDS). Attribute GIS GDS Home disciplines Geography Geography, Computing, Statistics Software focus Graphical User Interface Code Reproduciblility Minimal Maximal While embracing recent developments in the field, we also wanted to pay respects to the wider field of Geography, with its 2000 history (Roller 2010), and the narrower field of Geographic Information System (GIS) (Neteler and Mitasova 2008). Geography has played an important role in explaining and influencing humanity’s relationship with the natural world2 and this book aims to contribute to this so-called ‘Geographic Tradition’ (Livingstone 1992). GIS has become almost synonymous with handling spatial data on a computer, and provides a basis for excellent open source tools which can be accessed from R, as we will see in Chapter 13. The book’s links to older disciplines were reflected in suggested titles for the book: Geography with R and R for GIS. Each has advantages. The former conveys the message that it comprises much more than just spatial data: non-spatial attribute data are inevitably interwoven with geometry data, and Geography is about more than where something is on the map. The latter communicates that this is a book about using R as a GIS, to perform spatial operations on geographic data (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). However, the term GIS conveys some connotations (see Table 1.1) which simply fail to communicate one of R’s greatest strengths: its console-based ability to seamlessly switch between geographic and non-geographic data processing, modeling and visualization tasks. By contrast, the term geocomputation implies reproducible and creative programming. Of course, (geocomputational) algorithms are powerful tools that can become highly complex. However, all algorithms are composed of smaller parts. By teaching you its foundations and underlying structure, we aim to empower you to create your own innovative solutions to geographic data problems. 1.2 Why Geocomputation with R? Early geographers used a variety of tools including rulers, compasses and sextants to advance knowledge about the world. However, until John Harrison invented the marine chronometer in the 18th century it had been impossible to determine the exact longitude at sea (‘the longitude problem’). Prior to his invention ships followed for centuries a line of constant latitude making each journey much longer, more expensive and often also more dangerous. Nowadays this seems unimaginable with every smartphone having a GPS receiver at its disposal. And there are a multitude of other sensors measuring the world in real-time (satellites, radar, autonomous cars, citizens, etc.). For instance, an autonomous car could create 100 GB or more per day (see e.g., this article). Equally, earth observation data (satellite imagery) has become so big that it is impossible to analyze the corresponding data with a single computer (see http://r-spatial.org/2016/11/29/openeo.html). Hence, we need computational power, software and related tools to handle and extract the most interesting patterns of this ever-increasing amount of (geo-)data. (Geo-)Databases help with data management, storing and querying such large amounts of data. Through interfaces we can access subsets of these data for further analysis, information extraction and visualization. In this book we treat R as a ‘tool for the trade’ for the latter. R is a multi-platform, open source language for statistical computing and graphics (https://www.r-project.org/). With a wide range of packages R also supports advanced geospatial statistics, modeling and visualization.3. At its core R is an object-oriented, functional programming language (Wickham 2014), and was specifically designed as an interactive interface to other software (Chambers 2016). The latter also includes many ‘bridges’ to a treasure trove of GIS software, geolibraries and functions. It is thus ideal for quickly creating ‘geo-tools’, without needing to master lower level languages (compared to R) such as C, FORTRAN and Java (see section 1.3). This can feel like breaking free from the metaphorical ‘glass ceiling’ imposed by GUI-based proprietary geographic information systems (see Table 1.1 for a definition of GUI). What is more, advanced users might even extend R with the power of other languages (e.g., C++ through Rcpp or Python through reticulate; see also section 1.3). An example showing R’s flexibility with regard to geographic software development is its support for generating interactive maps thanks to leaflet (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2017). The packages tmap and mapview (Tennekes 2017; Appelhans et al. 2017) are built on and extend leaflet. These packages help overcome the criticism that R has “limited interactive [plotting] facilities” (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). The code below illustrates this by generating Figure 1.1. library(leaflet) popup = c(&quot;Robin&quot;, &quot;Jakub&quot;, &quot;Jannes&quot;) leaflet() %&gt;% addProviderTiles(&quot;NASAGIBS.ViirsEarthAtNight2012&quot;) %&gt;% addAwesomeMarkers(lng = c(-3, 23, 11), lat = c(52, 53, 49), popup = popup) Figure 1.1: World at night imagery from NASA overlaid by the authors’ approximate home locations to illustrate interactive mapping with R. It would have been difficult to produce Figure 1.1 using R a few years ago, let alone embed the results in an interactive html page (the interactive version can be viewed at robinlovelace.net/geocompr). This illustrates R’s flexibility and how, thanks to developments such as knitr and leaflet, it can be used as an interface to other software, a theme that will recur throughout this book. The use of R code, therefore, enables teaching geocomputation with reference to reproducible examples such as that provided in 1.1 rather than abstract concepts. 1.3 Software for geocomputation R is a powerful tool for geocomptation. However, other languages can be used and it is useful to be aware of these for historical context and to help understand the wider open source geospatial programming ecosystem, of which R is a part. With this motivation in mind the section briefly introduces the languages C++, Java and Python for geocomputation, with reference to R. A natural choice for geocomputation would be C++ since major GIS packages (e.g., GDAL, QGIS, GRASS, SAGA, and even ArcGIS) often rely in great parts on it. This is because well-written C++ can be blazzingly fast, which makes it a good choice for performance-critical applications such as the processing of large spatial data. Usually, people find it harder to learn than Python or R. It is also likely that you have to invest a lot of time to code things that are readily available in R. Therefore, we would recommend to learn R, and subsequently to learn C++ through Rcpp if a need for performance optimization arises. Subsequently, you could even implement geoalgorithms you are missing from the most common desktop GIS with the help of Rcpp4. Java is another important (and versatile) language used in GIScience. For example, the open-source desktop GIS gvSig, OpenJump and uDig are written in Java. There are also many open source add-on libraries available for Java, including GeoTools and the Java Topology Suite.5 Furthermore, many server-based applications use Java including among others Geoserver/Geonode, deegree and 52°North WPS. Java’s object-oriented syntax is similar to C++, however, its memory management is much simpler. Still, it is rather unforgiving regarding class, object and variable declarations forcing you to think about a well-designed programming structure. This is especially useful in large projects with thousands of lines of codes placed in numerous files. Following the write once, run anywhere principle, Java is platform-independent (which is unusual for a compiled programming language). Overall, Java’s compiled language has an excellent performance on large-scale systems making it a suitable candidate for complex architecture projects such as programming a desktop GIS. However, Java is probably less suitable for statistical modeling and visualization compared to Python or R. First and foremost, though you can do data science with Java (Brzustowicz 2017), Java offers much fewer statistical libraries especially when compared with R. Secondly, interpreted languages (such as R and Python) are often easier to write (at the prize of lower performance) than compiled languages (such as Java and C++). Moreover, interpreted languages allow a faster and interactive (line-by-line) code implementation. Finally, R’s native support of data types such as data frames and matrices is especially advantageous when it comes to analyzing data. Lastly, we will introduce Python for geocomputation Many people believe that R and Python are battling for supremacy in the field of data science. This is accompanied by a partly offensive as much as often rather subjective discussion on what to learn or what to use. We believe that both languages have their merits, and in the end it is about doing geocomputation and communicating the corresponding results regardless of the chosen software. Moreover, both languages are object-oriented, and have lots of further things in common. Learning one language should give you a headstart when choosing to learn the other as well. R’s major advantage is that statisticians wrote hundreds of statistical packages (unmatched by Python) explicitly for other statisticians. By contrast, Python’s major advantage is that it is (unlike R) a multi-purpose language thereby bringing together people from diverse fields which also explains Python’s bigger user base compared to R’s. So if you like Python better or you think it better suits your needs (for example because you are also interested in web and GUI development), go for it. In fact, we often advise our students to start with Python just because the major GIS software packages provide Python libraries that lets the user access its geoalgorithms from the Python command line6. However, when the teaching moves on to statistical geoprocessing and spatial predictive modeling we guide them towards R where they can take advantage of the concepts already learned through Python. Nevertheless, you can also use Python for the most common statistical learning techniques (though R tends to be more on the bleeding edge regarding new statistical development including those in the geostatistical community). In addition, Python also offers excellent support for spatial data analysis and manipulation (see packages osgeo, Shapely, NumPy, osgeo, PyGeoProcessing). We refer you to Garrard (2016) for an introduction to geoprocessing with Python. 1.4 R’s spatial ecosystem Before cracking-on with the action, a few introductory remarks are needed to explain the approach taken here and provide context. There are many ways to handle spatial data in R, with dozens of packages in the area.7 In this book we endeavor to teach the state-of-the-art in the field whilst ensuring that the methods are future-proof. Like many areas of software development, R’s spatial ecosystem is rapidly evolving. Because R is open source, these developments can easily build on previous work, by ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’, as Isaac Newton put it in 1675. This approach is advantageous because it encourages collaboration and avoids ‘reinventing the wheel’. The package sf (covered in Chapter 2), for example, builds on its predecessor sp. A surge in development time (and interest) in ‘R-Geo’ has followed the award of a grant by the R Consortium for the development of support for Simple Features, an open-source standard and model to store and access vector geometries. This resulted in the sf package (covered in 2.1.1). Multiple places reflect the immense interest in sf. This is especially true for the R-sig-Geo Archives, a long-standing open access email list containing much R-spatial wisdom accumulated over the years. Many posts on the list now discuss sf and related packages, suggesting that R’s spatial software developers are using the package and, therefore, it is here to stay. We even propose that the release of sf heralds a new era for spatial data analysis and geocomputation in R. This era8 clearly has the wind in its sails, and is set to dominate future developments in R’s spatial ecosystem for years to come. So time invested in learning the ‘new ways’ of handling spatial data and, hopefully, reading this book, is well spent! Figure 1.2: The popularity of spatial packages in R. The y-axis shows the average number of downloads, within a 30-day rolling window, of R’s top 5 spatial packages, defined as those with the highest number of downloads within the last 30 days. It is noteworthy that shifts in the wider R community, as exemplified by the data processing package dplyr (released in 2014) influenced shifts in R’s spatial ecosystem. Alongside other packages that have a shared style and emphasis on ‘tidy data’ (including e.g., ggplot2), dplyr was placed in the tidyverse ‘metapackage’ in late 2016. The tidyverse approach, with its focus on long-form data and fast, intuitively named functions, has become immensely popular. This has led to a demand for ‘tidy spatial data’ which has been partly met by sf and other approaches such as the GitHub package tabularaster. An obvious feature of the tidyverse is the tendency for packages to work in harmony. Although an equivalent geoverse is presently missing, there is an on-going discussion of harmonizing R’s many spatial packages.9 and a growing number of actively developed packages which are designed to work in harmony with sf (Table 1.2) and Table 1.2: The top 5 most downloaded packages that depend on sf, in terms of average number of downloads per day over the previous month. As of 2017-09-26 there are 29 packages which import sf. package Downloads plotly 1818 leaflet 638 geojsonio 204 mapview 166 rmapshaper 135 1.5 R’s spatial history There are many benefits of using recent packages such as sf, with the caveat that they are generally less stable than mature packages such as its predecessor, the sp-package. The saying “if you live on the cutting edge you risk getting hurt” captures this well, meaning that older packages may be more appropriate for applications requiring stability and backwards-compatibility with other mature packages. Another reason for knowing about the history of geocomputation with R is that there is a wealth of functions, use-cases and teaching material written using older packages in R’s spatial ecosystem, which can still be useful today if you know where to look. The beginnings of spatial capabilities in R are closely connected with its predecessor - the S language (Bivand and Gebhardt 2000). The 1990s saw the development of numerous S scripts and a handful of packages for spatial statistics. By the year 2000, there were already R packages for performing various tasks, including “point pattern analysis, geostatistics, exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial econometrics”, as described in an article presented at the GeoComputation2000 conference (Bivand and Neteler 2000). Some of these, including spatial, sgeostat and splancs, can still be downloaded as R packages (Rowlingson and Diggle 1993; Rowlingson and Diggle 2017; Venables and Ripley 2002; University and Gebhardt 2016). Volume 1/2 of R News (the predecessor of The R Journal) contained an overview of spatial statistical software in R at the time, much of which was based on previous code written for S/S-PLUS (Ripley 2001). This overview described packages for spatial smoothing and interpolation (e.g., akima, spatial, sgeostat and geoR) and point pattern analysis (splancs and spatstat; Akima and Gebhardt 2016; Rowlingson and Diggle 2017; Jr and Diggle 2016). While all these are still available on CRAN, spatstat stands out among them, as it remains dominant in the field of spatial point pattern analysis (Baddeley, Rubak, and Turner 2015). The following R News issue (Volume 1/3) put spatial packages in the spotlight again, with an introduction to splancs and a commentary on future prospects regarding spatial statistics (Bivand 2001). Additionally, the issue introduced two packages for testing spatial autocorrelation that eventually became part of spdep (Bivand 2017). Notably, the commentary mentions the need for standardization of spatial interfaces, efficient mechanisms for exchanging data with GIS, and handling of spatial metadata such as coordinate reference systems (CRS). maptools (written by Nicholas Lewin-Koh; Bivand and Lewin-Koh 2017) is another important package from this time. Initially, maptools just contained a wrapper around shapelib, and permitted the reading of ESRI Shapefiles into geometry nested lists. The corresponding and nowadays obsolete S3 class called “Map” stored this list alongside an attribute data frame. The work on the “Map” class representation was nevertheless important since it directly fed into sp prior to its publication on CRAN. In 2003, Hornik et al. (2003) published an extended review of spatial packages. Around this time the development of R’s spatial capabilities increasingly supported interfaces to external libraries, especially to GDAL and PROJ.4. These interfaces facilitated geographic data I/O (covered in chapter 5) and CRS transformations, respectively. Bivand (2003) proposed a spatial data class system, including support for points, lines, polygons and grids based on GDAL’s support for a wide range of spatial data formats. All these ideas contributed to the packages rgdal and sp, which became the foundational packages for spatial data analysis with R (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). rgdal provided GDAL bindings for R which greatly extended R’s spatial capabilities in terms of access to previously unavailable spatial data formats. Initially, Tim Keitt released it in 2003 with support for raster drivers. But soon, rgdal also enabled storing information about coordinate reference system (building on top of the PROJ.4 library), allowed map projections, datum transformations and OGR vector reading. Many of these additional capabilities were thanks to Barry Rowlingson who folded them into the rgdal codebase in March 2006.10 sp, released in 2005, overcame R’s inability to distinguish spatial and non-spatial objects. It grew from a workshop before, and a session at the 2003 DSC conference in Vienna, gathering input from most interested package developers. At the same time, sourceforge was chosen for development collaboration (migrated to R-Forge five years later) and the R-sig-geo mailing list was started. Prior to 2005, spatial coordinates were generally treated as any other number. This changed with sp as it provided generic classes and methods for spatial data. The sophisticated class system supported points, lines, polygons and grids, with and without attribute data. Making use of the S4 class system, sp stores each piece of ‘spatially specific’ information (such as bounding box, coordinate reference system, attribute table) in slots, which are accessible via the @ symbol. For instance, sp-classes store attribute data in the data slot as a data.frame. This enables non-spatial data operations to work alongside spatial operations (covered in chapters 3 and 4, respectively). Additionally, sp implemented generic methods for spatial data types for well-known functions such as summary() and plot() . In the following, sp classes rapidly became the go-to standard for spatial data in R, resulting in a proliferation of packages that depended on it from around 20 in 2008 and over 100 in 2013 (Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio 2013). Now more than 200 packages rely on sp, making it an important part of the R ecosystem. Prominent R packages using sp include: gstat, for spatial and spatio-temporal geostatistics; geosphere, for spherical trigonometry; and adehabitat used for the analysis of habitat selection by animals (Pebesma and Graeler 2017; Calenge 2006; Hijmans 2016a). While rgdal and sp solved many spatial issues, R was still lacking geometry calculation abilities. Therefore, Colin Rundel started to develop a package that interfaces GEOS, an open-source geometry library, during a Google Summer of Coding project in 2010. The resulting rgeos package (first released in 2010; Bivand and Rundel 2017) brought geometry calculations to R by allowing functions and operators from the GEOS library to manipulate sp objects. Another limitation of sp was its limited support of raster data. The raster-package (first released in 2010; Hijmans 2016b) overcame this by providing a raster class and functions for creating, reading and writing raster data. A key feature of raster is its ability to work with datasets that are too large to fit into the main memory (RAM), thereby overcoming one of R’s major limitations when working on raster data.11 In parallel with or partly even preceding the development of spatial classes and methods came the support for R as an interface to dedicated GIS software. The GRASS package (Bivand 2000) and follow-on packages spgrass6 and rgrass7 (for GRASS GIS 6 and 7, respectively) were prominent examples in this direction (R. Bivand 2016b; R. Bivand 2016a). Other examples of bridges between R and GIS include RSAGA (Brenning and Bangs 2016, first published in 2008), ArcGIS (Brenning 2012, first published in 2008), and RQGIS (Muenchow and Schratz 2017, first published in 2016). Map making was not a focus of R’s early spatial capabilities. But soon sp provided methods for advanced map making using both the base and lattice plotting system. Despite this, a demand for the layered grammar of graphics was growing especially after the release of ggplot2 in 2007. ggmap extended ggplot2’s spatial capabilities (Kahle and Wickham 2013). However, its main purpose was the easy access of several APIs to automatically download map tiles (among others, Google Maps and OpenStreetmap) and subsequent plotting of these as a basemap. Though ggmap facilitated map-making with ggplot2, one main limitation remained. To make spatial data work with the ggplot2 system, one needed to fortify spatial objects. Basically, this means, you need to combine the coordinates and attribute slots of a spatial class object into one data frame. While this works well in the case of points, it duplicates the same information over and over again in the case of polygons, since each coordinate (vertex) of a polygon receives the attribute data of the polygon. This is especially disadvantageous if you need to deal with tens of thousands of polygons. With the introduction of simple features to R this limitation disappears, and it seems likely that this will make ggplot2 the standard tool for the visualization of vector data. This might be different regarding the visualization of raster data. Raster visualization methods received a boost with the release of rasterVis (Lamigueiro 2014) which builds on top of the lattice system. More recently, new packages aim at easing the creation of complex, high-quality maps with minimal code. The tmap package (released in 2014) might serve as an archetype for this kind of development (Tennekes 2017). It facilitates the user-friendly creation of thematic maps with an intuitive command-line interface (see also mapmisc) . tmap is a sophisticated yet user friendly mapping package which works in harmony with the leaflet package (released in 2015) for interactive map making (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2017). Similarly, the mapview package builds also on top of leaflet (Appelhans et al. 2017) for interactive mapping based on sp or sf objects. mapview allows the access of a wide range of background maps, scale bars and more. However, it is noteworthy that among all the recent developments described above, the support for simple features (sf; Pebesma 2017) has been without doubt the most important evolution in R’s spatial ecosystem. Naturally, this is the reason why we will describe sf in detail in Chapter 2. 1.6 Exercises Think about the terms ‘GIS’, ‘GDS’ and ‘Geocomputation’ described above. Which is your favorite, and why? Provide three reasons for using a scriptable language such as R for geocomputation instead of using an established GIS program such as QGIS. Name two advantages and two disadvantages of using mature packages compared with ‘cutting edge’ packages for spatial data (for example sp vs sf). References "],

We assume that you have installed on your computer a recent version of R and that you are comfortable using it at the command line, e.g., via an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio (recommended). R/RStudio works on all major operating systems. You can install and set up both in a few minutes on most modern computers, as described in section 2.3 and section 2.5 of Gillespie and Lovelace (2016) (other guides are available). If you are not a regular R user, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the language before proceeding with this chapter. You can do so using resources such as Gillespie and Lovelace (2016), Grolemund and Wickham (2016) as well as online interactive guides such as DataCamp. We recommend organising your work as you learn, for example with the help of an RStudio ‘project’ called geocomp-learning or similar and a new script for each chapter. The code you type to help learn the content of this chapter, for example, could be placed in script called chapter-02.R. Everyone learns in a different way so it is important that you structure your code in a way that makes sense to you and that you avoid copy-pasting to get used to typing code. After testing your up-to-date R/RStudio set-up, the next step is to load and install spatial packages. The sf, raster, spData, and spDataLarge packages used in this chapter can be installed and loaded as follows: install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) install.packages(&quot;raster&quot;) install.packages(&quot;spData&quot;) library(sf) library(raster) library(spData) install.packages(&quot;spDataLarge&quot;) library(spDataLarge) On Mac and Linux operating systems a few requirements must be met, as described in the sf README file for details. This chapter will provide brief explanations of the fundamental geographic data models: vector and raster. We will introduce the theory behind each data model and the disciplines in which they predominate, before demonstrating their implementation in R. The vector data model represents the world using points, lines and polygons. This means, it supports data with discrete, well-defined borders. Generally, vector datasets have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy as we will see in 2.4). The raster data model is good at representing continuous phenomena such as elevation or rainfall with the help of grid cells that divide the surface up into a cells of constant size (resolution). Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are spatially consistent and scalable (many worldwide raster datasets are available). The downside of this is that small features can be blurred or lost. The appropriate data model to use depends on the domain of application: Vector data tends to dominate the social sciences because human settlements and boundaries have discrete borders. By contrast, raster data often dominates the environmental sciences because these often use remotely sensed imagery. However, there is a substantial level of overlap: ecologists and demographers, for example, commonly use both vector and raster data. We, therefore, strongly recommend learning about each data model before proceeding to understand how to manipulate them in subsequent chapters. This book uses sf and raster packages to work with vector data and raster datasets respectively. 2.1 Vector data The geographic vector model is based on points located within a coordinate reference system (CRS). Points can represent self-standing features (e.g. the location of a bus stop) or they can be linked together to form more complex geometry types, lines and polygons. Most points in geographic work contain only two dimensions, represented by ‘Northing and Easting’ (for projected or Cartesian CRSs) or Longitude and Latitude (for geographic CRSs) pairs. These numbers represent point’s distance from an \\(origin\\) along the \\(x\\) (horizontal) and \\(y\\) (vertical) axis. In 3 dimensional CRSs three numbers are needed: \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Take care when using the word ‘vector’ as it can have two meanings in this book: geographic vector data and vectors (note the monospace font) in R. The former is a data model, the latter is an R class just like data.frame and matrix. Still, there is a link between the two: the spatial coordinates which are at the heart of the geographic vector data model can be represented in R using vector objects. In mathematical notation these points are typically represented as numbers separated by commas and enclosed by a pair of brackets: \\((1, 3)\\) for example, represents a point located one unit to the right and three units above the origin. Instead of creating these points manually, one would commonly read-in data with functions such as read_csv() from the tidyverse or read_sf() from the sf package (see chapter 5). To generate new data (e.g., for testing), one can use the command c() (think of ‘c’ for ‘combine’), as illustrated below:12 p = c(1, 3) Now this can be plotted in Cartesian space, as illustrated in figure 2.1: plot(x = p[1], y = p[2], xlim = c(0, 5), ylim = c(0, 5)) Figure 2.1: Illustration of vector point data in base R. 2.1.1 An introduction to simple features Simple features is an open standard developed and endorsed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to represent a wide range of geographic information. It is a hierarchical data model that simplifies geographic data by condensing a complex range of geographic forms into a single geometry class. Only 7 out of 68 possible types of simple feature are currently used in the vast majority of GIS operations (Figure 2.2). The R package sf (Pebesma 2017) fully supports all of these (including plotting methods etc.).13 Figure 2.2: The subset of the Simple Features class hierarchy supported by sf. Figure based on the Open Geospatial Consortium document 06-103r4. sf can represent all common vector geometry types (raster data classes are not supported by sf): points, lines, polygons and their respective ‘multi’ versions (which group together features of the same type into a single feature). sf also supports geometry collections, which can contain multiple geometry types in a single object. Given the breadth of geographic data forms, it may come as a surprise that a class system to support all of them is provided in a single package, which can be installed from CRAN:14 sf incorporates the functionality of the three main packages of the sp paradigm (sp (Pebesma and Bivand 2017) for the class system, rgdal (Bivand, Keitt, and Rowlingson 2017) for reading and writing data, rgeos (Bivand and Rundel 2017) for spatial operations undertaken by GEOS) in a single, cohesive whole. This is well-documented in sf’s vignettes: vignette(&quot;sf1&quot;) # for an introduction to the package vignette(&quot;sf2&quot;) # for reading, writing and converting Simple Features vignette(&quot;sf3&quot;) # for manipulating Simple Features As the first vignette explains, simple feature objects in R are stored in a data frame, with geographic data occupying a special column, a ‘list-column’. This column is usually named ‘geom’ or ‘geometry’. Let us load a ‘real world’ example, here the world dataset, with the help of the spData package: library(spData) spData silently loaded the world dataset (and many other spatial datasets - see the spData website for a full list). This dataset contains spatial and non-spatial information, as shown by the function names(), which reports the column headings in data frames. Please note that the last column contains the geographic information: names(world) #&gt; [1] &quot;iso_a2&quot; &quot;name_long&quot; &quot;continent&quot; &quot;region_un&quot; &quot;subregion&quot; #&gt; [6] &quot;type&quot; &quot;area_km2&quot; &quot;pop&quot; &quot;lifeExp&quot; &quot;gdpPercap&quot; #&gt; [11] &quot;geom&quot; It is the contents of this modest-looking geom column that gives sf objects their spatial powers. This so-called list-column contains all the coordinates. sf’s plot() method uses these coordinates to create a map (Figure 2.3). library(sf) # must be loaded to plot sf objects #&gt; Linking to GEOS 3.5.0, GDAL 2.1.0, proj.4 4.8.0 plot(world) #&gt; Warning: plotting the first 9 out of 10 attributes; use max.plot = 10 to #&gt; plot all Figure 2.3: A spatial plot of the world using the sf package, with a facet for each attribute. Note that instead of creating a single map, as most GIS programs would, the plot() command has created multiple maps, one for each variable in the world datasets. This behavior can be useful for exploring the spatial distribution of different variables and is discussed further in 2.1.3 below. Being able to treat spatial objects as regular data frames with spatial powers has many advantages, especially if you are already used to working with data frames. The commonly used summary() function, for example, provides a useful overview of the variables within the world object. summary(world[&quot;lifeExp&quot;]) #&gt; lifeExp geom #&gt; Min. :48.9 MULTIPOLYGON :177 #&gt; 1st Qu.:64.3 epsg:4326 : 0 #&gt; Median :72.8 +proj=long...: 0 #&gt; Mean :70.6 #&gt; 3rd Qu.:77.1 #&gt; Max. :83.6 #&gt; NA&#39;s :9 Although we have only selected one variable for the summary command, it also outputs an report on the geometry (we explore such ‘attribute operations’ in more depth in Chapter 3). This is due to the sticky behavior of the geometry columns of sf objects (see Chapter 3). Hence, the result provides a quick summary of both the non-spatial and spatial data contained in world: the average life expectancy is 73 years (ranging from less than 50 to more than 80 years) across all countries which are represented in the form of MULTIPOLYGONs. MULTIPOLYGONs allow more than one polygon per row (here: country). This representation is necessary for countries with many islands such as Indonesia and Greece. It is worth taking a deeper look at the basic behavior and contents of this simple feature object, which can usefully be thought of as a ’Spatial dataFrame). sf objects are easy to subset. The code below shows its first two rows and three columns. The output shows two major differences compared with a regular data.frame: the inclusion of additional geographic data (geometry type, dimension, bbox and CRS information - epsg (SRID), proj4string), and the presence of final geometry column: world[1:2, 1:3] #&gt; Simple feature collection with 2 features and 3 fields #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 11.6401 ymin: -17.93064 xmax: 75.15803 ymax: 38.48628 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; iso_a2 name_long continent geom #&gt; 1 AF Afghanistan Asia MULTIPOLYGON (((61.21081709... #&gt; 2 AO Angola Africa MULTIPOLYGON (((16.32652835... All this may seem rather complex, especially for a class system that is supposed to be simple. However, there are good reasons for organizing things this way and using sf. 2.1.2 Why Simple Features? There are many advantages of sf over sp, including: Faster reading and writing of data (more than 10 times faster in some cases) Better plotting performance sf objects can be treated as data frames in most operations sf functions can be combined using %&gt;% operator and works well with the tidyverse collection of R packages sf function names are relatively consistent and intuitive (all begin with st_) compared with the function names and syntax of the sp, rgdal and rgeos packages that it supersedes. A broader advantage is that simple features are so well-supported by other software products, not least PostGIS, which has heavily influenced the design of sf. A disadvantage you should be aware of, however, is that sf is not feature complete and that it continues to evolve. The transition from sp to sf will likely take many years, and many spatial packages may never switch. Even if you discover spatial data with R through the sf package, it is still worth at least being aware of sp classes, even if you rarely use them for everyday geospatial tasks. Fortunately it is easy to translate between sp and sf using the as() function: library(sp) world_sp = as(object = world, Class = &quot;Spatial&quot;) Bivand, Pebesma, and Gómez-Rubio (2013) provides an excellent introduction to sp. 2.1.3 Basic map making You can quickly create basic maps in sf with the base plot() function. By default, sf creates a multi-panel plot (like sp’s spplot()), one sub-plot for each variable (see left-hand image in Figure 2.4). plot(world[3:4]) plot(world[&quot;pop&quot;]) Figure 2.4: Plotting with sf, with multiple variables (left) and a single variable (right). As with sp, you can add further layers to your maps using the add = TRUE-argument of the plot() function .15 To illustrate this, and prepare for content covered in chapters 3 and 4 on attribute and spatial data operations, we will subset and combine countries in the world object, which creates a single object representing Asia: asia = world[world$continent == &quot;Asia&quot;, ] asia = st_union(asia) We can now plot the Asian continent over a map of the world. Note, however, that this only works if the initial plot has only one layer: plot(world[&quot;pop&quot;]) plot(asia, add = TRUE, col = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 2.5: A plot of Asia added as a layer on top of countries worldwide. This can be very useful for quickly checking the geographic correspondence between two or more layers: the plot() function is fast to execute and requires few lines of code, but does not create interactive maps with a wide range of options. For more advanced map making we recommend using a dedicated visualization package such as tmap, ggplot2, mapview, or leaflet. 2.1.3.1 Further work sf simplifies spatial data objects compared with sp and provides a near-direct interface to GDAL and GEOS C++ functions. In theory this should make sf faster than sp/rgdal/rgeos, something that is tested in Chapter 5 for data I/O. This section introduces sf classes in preparation for subsequent chapters which deal with vector data (in particular Chapter 4). As a final exercise, we will see one way of how to do a spatial overlay in sf. First, we convert the countries of the world into centroids, and then subset those in Asia. Finally, the summary-command tells us how many centroids (countries) are part of Asia (43) and how many are not (134). world_centroids = st_centroid(world) #&gt; Warning in st_centroid.sfc(st_geometry(x), of_largest_polygon = #&gt; of_largest_polygon): st_centroid does not give correct centroids for #&gt; longitude/latitude data sel_asia = st_intersects(world_centroids, asia, sparse = FALSE) #&gt; although coordinates are longitude/latitude, it is assumed that they are planar summary(sel_asia) #&gt; V1 #&gt; Mode :logical #&gt; FALSE:134 #&gt; TRUE :43 Note: st_intersects() uses GEOS in the background for the spatial overlay operation (see also Chapter 4). Since sf’s plot() function builds on base plotting methods, you may also use its many optional arguments (see ?plot and ?par). This provides powerful but not necessarily intuitive functionality. For instance, in order to make the diameter of a circle proportional to a country’s population, we provide the cex argument with the result of a calculation (see Figure 2.6, and the code below). plot(world[&quot;continent&quot;]) plot(world_centroids, add = TRUE, cex = world$pop / 1e8, lwd = 3) Figure 2.6: Centroids representing country population, diameter being proportional to population. 2.1.4 Simple feature classes To understand new data formats in depth, it often helps to build them from the ground up. This section walks you through vector spatial classes step-by-step, from the elementary simple feature geometry to simple feature objects of class sf representing complex spatial data. Before describing each geometry type that the sf package supports, it is worth taking a step back to understand the building blocks of sf objects. As stated in section 2.1.1, simple features are simply data frames with at least one special column that makes it spatial. These spatial columns are often called geom or geometry and can be like non-spatial columns: world$geom refers to the spatial element of the world object described above. These geometry columns are ‘list columns’ of class sfc: they are simple feature collections. In turn, sfc objects are composed of one or more objects of class sfg: simple feature geometries. To understand how the spatial components of simple features work, it is vital to understand simple feature geometries. For this reason we cover each currently supported sfg type in the next subsections before moving on to describe how these can be combined to form sfc and eventually full sf objects. 2.1.4.1 Simple feature geometry types Geometries are the basic building blocks of simple features. Simple features in R can take on one of the 17 geometry types supported by the sf package. In this chapter we will focus on the seven most commonly used types: POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON, MULTIPOINT, MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOLYGON and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION. Find the whole list of possible feature types in the PostGIS manual. Generally, well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT) are the standard encoding for simple feature geometries. WKB representations are usually hexadecimal strings easily readable for computers. This is why, GIS and spatial databases use WKB to transfer and store geometry objects. WKT, on the other hand, is a human-readable text markup description of simple features. Both formats are exchangeable, and if we present one, we will naturally choose the WKT representation. The basis for each geometry type is the point. A point is simply a coordinate in 2D, 3D or 4D space (see vignette(&quot;sf1&quot;) for more information) such as: POINT (5 2) A linestring is a sequence of points with a straight line connecting the points, for example: LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2) A polygon is a sequence of points that form a closed, non-intersecting ring. Closed means that the first and the last point of a polygon have the same coordinates. By definition, a polygon has one exterior boundary (outer ring) and can have zero or more interior boundaries (inner rings), also known as holes. Polygon without a hole - POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) Polygon with one hole - POLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4)) So far, our geometry types have just included one feature. To represent multiple features in one object, we can use the “multi”-version of each geometry type: Multipoint - MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2) Multistring - MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4)) Multipolygon - MULTIPOLYGON ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)) Finally, a geometry collection might contain any combination of geometry types: Geometry collection - GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))) 2.1.4.2 Simple feature geometry (sfg) objects In R, the sfg class represents the different simple feature geometry types: (multi-)point, (multi-)linestring, (multi-)polygon or geometry collection. Usually you are spared the tedious task of creating geometries on your own since you can simply import an already existing spatial file. However, there are a set of function to create simple feature geometry objects (sfg) from scratch if needed. The names of these functions are simple and consistent, as they all start with the st_ prefix and end with the name of the geometry type in lowercase letters: A point - st_point() A linestring - st_linestring() A polygon - st_polygon() A multipoint - st_multipoint() A multilinestring - st_multilinestring() A multipolygon - st_multipolygon() A geometry collection - st_geometrycollection() In R, you create sfg objects with the help of three native data types: A numeric vector - a single point A matrix - a set of points, where each row contains a point - a multipoint or linestring A list - any other set, e.g. a multilinestring or geometry collection To create point objects, we use the st_point() function in conjunction with a numeric vector: # note that we use a numeric vector for points st_point(c(5, 2)) # XY point #&gt; POINT (5 2) st_point(c(5, 2, 3)) # XYZ point #&gt; POINT Z (5 2 3) st_point(c(5, 2, 1), dim = &quot;XYM&quot;) # XYM point #&gt; POINT M (5 2 1) st_point(c(5, 2, 3, 1)) # XYZM point #&gt; POINT ZM (5 2 3 1) XY, XYZ and XYZM types of points are automatically created based on the length of a numeric vector. Only the XYM type needs to be specified using a dim argument. By contrast, use matrices in the case of multipoint (st_multipoint()) and linestring (st_linestring()) objects: # the rbind function simplifies the creation of matrices ## MULTIPOINT multipoint_matrix = rbind(c(5, 2), c(1, 3), c(3, 4), c(3, 2)) st_multipoint(multipoint_matrix) #&gt; MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2) ## LINESTRING linestring_matrix = rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)) st_linestring(linestring_matrix) #&gt; LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2) Finally, use lists for the creation of multilinestrings, (multi-)polygons and geometry collections: ## POLYGON polygon_list = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))) st_polygon(polygon_list) #&gt; POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) ## POLYGON with a hole polygon_border = rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)) polygon_hole = rbind(c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4)) polygon_with_hole_list = list(polygon_border, polygon_hole) st_polygon(polygon_with_hole_list) #&gt; POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (2 4, 3 4, 3 3, 2 3, 2 4)) ## MULTILINESTRING multilinestring_list = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)), rbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4))) st_multilinestring((multilinestring_list)) #&gt; MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4)) ## MULTIPOLYGON multipolygon_list = list(list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))), list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2)))) st_multipolygon(multipolygon_list) #&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)), ((0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2))) ## GEOMETRYCOLLECTION gemetrycollection_list = list(st_multipoint(multipoint_matrix), st_linestring(linestring_matrix)) st_geometrycollection(gemetrycollection_list) #&gt; GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)) 2.1.4.3 Simple feature collections One sfg object contains only a single simple feature geometry. A simple feature collection (sfc) is a list of sfg objects and can additionally contain information about the coordinate reference system in use. For instance, to combine two simple features into one object with two features, we can use the st_sfc() function. This is important since this collection represents the geometry column in sf data frames: # sfc POINT point1 = st_point(c(5, 2)) point2 = st_point(c(1, 3)) st_sfc(point1, point2) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: NA #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) In most cases, an sfc object contains objects of the same geometry type. Therefore, when we convert sfg objects of type polygon into a simple feature collection, we would also end up with an sfc object of type polygon. Equally, a collection of multilinestrings would result in an sfc object of type multilinestring: # sfc POLYGON polygon_list1 = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))) polygon1 = st_polygon(polygon_list) polygon_list2 = list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2))) polygon2 = st_polygon(polygon_list2) st_sfc(polygon1, polygon2) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 0 ymin: 1 xmax: 4 ymax: 5 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: NA #&gt; POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) #&gt; POLYGON ((0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)) # sfc MULTILINESTRING multilinestring_list1 = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2)), rbind(c(1, 2), c(2, 4))) multilinestring1 = st_multilinestring((multilinestring_list1)) multilinestring_list2 = list(rbind(c(2, 9), c(7, 9), c(5, 6), c(4, 7), c(2, 7)), rbind(c(1, 7), c(3, 8))) multilinestring2 = st_multilinestring((multilinestring_list2)) st_sfc(multilinestring1, multilinestring2) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: MULTILINESTRING #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 1 xmax: 7 ymax: 9 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: NA #&gt; MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 ... #&gt; MULTILINESTRING ((2 9, 7 9, 5 6, 4 7, 2 7), (1 ... It is also possible to create an sfc object from sfg objects with different geometry types: # sfc GEOMETRY st_sfc(point1, multilinestring1) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: GEOMETRY #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 1 xmax: 5 ymax: 5 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: NA #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 ... As mentioned before, sfc objects can additionally store information on the coordinate reference systems (CRS). To specify a certain CRS, we can use the epsg (SRID) or proj4string attributes of an sfc object. The default value of epsg (SRID) and proj4string is NA (Not Available): st_sfc(point1, point2) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: NA #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) Of course, all geometries in an sfc object must have the same CRS. We can add coordinate reference system as a crs argument of st_sfc(). This argument accepts either an integer with the epsg code (e.g., 4326) or a proj4string character string (e.g., &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs&quot;) (see section 2.3). # EPSG definition st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = 4326) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) # PROJ4STRING definition st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = &quot;+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs&quot;) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) For example, we can set the UTM Zone 11N projection with epsg code 2955: st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = 2955) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 2955 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) As you can see above, the proj4string definition was automatically added. Now we can try to set the CRS using proj4string: st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = &quot;+proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs&quot;) #&gt; Geometry set for 2 features #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 1 ymin: 2 xmax: 5 ymax: 3 #&gt; epsg (SRID): NA #&gt; proj4string: +proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs #&gt; POINT (5 2) #&gt; POINT (1 3) However, the epsg string of our result remained empty. This is because there is no general method to convert from proj4string to epsg. 2.1.4.4 Simple feature objects So far, we have only dealt with the pure geometries. Most of the time, however, these geometries come with a set of attributes describing them. These attributes could represent the name of the geometry, measured values, groups to which the geometry belongs, and many more. For example, we measured a temperature of 25°C on Trafalgar Square in London on June 21th 2017. Hence, we have a specific point in space (the coordinates), the name of the location (Trafalgar Square), a temperature value, the date of the measurement. Other attributes might include a urbanity category (city or village), or a remark if the measurement was made using an automatic station. The simple feature class, sf, is a combination of an attribute table (data.frame) and a simple feature geometry collection (sfc). Simple features are created using the st_sf() function: # sfg objects london_point = st_point(c(0.1, 51.5)) ruan_point = st_point(c(-9, 53)) # sfc object our_geometry = st_sfc(london_point, ruan_point, crs = 4326) # data.frame object our_attributes = data.frame(name = c(&quot;London&quot;, &quot;Ruan&quot;), temperature = c(25, 13), date = c(as.Date(&quot;2017-06-21&quot;), as.Date(&quot;2017-06-22&quot;)), category = c(&quot;city&quot;, &quot;village&quot;), automatic = c(FALSE, TRUE)) # sf object sf_points = st_sf(our_attributes, geometry = our_geometry) The above example illustrates the components of sf objects. Firstly, coordinates define the geometry of the simple feature geometry (sfg). Secondly, we can combine the geometries in a simple feature collection (sfc) which also stores the CRS. Subsequently, we store the attribute information on the geometries in a data.frame. Finally, the st_sf() function combines the attribute table and the sfc object in an sf object. sf_points #&gt; Simple feature collection with 2 features and 5 fields #&gt; geometry type: POINT #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: -9 ymin: 51.5 xmax: 0.1 ymax: 53 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; name temperature date category automatic geometry #&gt; 1 London 25 2017-06-21 city FALSE POINT (0.1 51.5) #&gt; 2 Ruan 13 2017-06-22 village TRUE POINT (-9 53) class(sf_points) #&gt; [1] &quot;sf&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; The result shows that sf objects actually have two classes, sf and data.frame. Simple features are simply data frames (square tables), but with spatial attributes (usually stored in a special geom list-column in the data frame). This duality is central to the concept of simple features: most of the time a sf can be treated as and behaves like a data.frame. Simple features are, in essence, data frames with a spatial extension. 2.2 Raster data Figure 2.7: Raster data: A - a grid representation; B - numbers of the cells; C - values of the cells; D - a final raster map. The geographic raster data model consists of a raster header and a matrix (with rows and columns) representing equally spaced cells (often also called pixels; Figure 2.7:A). The raster header defines the coordinate reference system, the extent and the origin. The origin (or starting point) is frequently the coordinate of the lower-left corner of the matrix (the raster package, however, uses the upper left corner, by default (Figure 2.7:B)). The header defines the extent via the number of columns, the number of rows and the cell size resolution. Hence, starting from the origin, we can easily access and modify each single cell by either using the ID of a cell (Figure 2.7:B) or by explicitly specifying the rows and columns. This matrix representation avoids storing explicitly the coordinates for the four corner points (in fact it only stores one coordinate, namely the origin) of each cell corner as would be the case for rectangular vector polygons. This and matrix algebra makes raster processing much more efficient and faster than vector data processing. However, in contrast to vector data, a raster cell can only hold a single value. The value might be numeric or categorical (Figure 2.7:C). You can also specify a no-data value in the header of a raster, frequently -9999 (in R we often use NA). Raster maps usually represent continuous phenomena such as elevation, temperature, population density or spectral data (Figure 2.8). Of course, we can represent discrete features such as soil or landcover classes also with the help of a raster data model (Figure 2.8). Consequently, the discrete borders of these features become blurred, and depending on the spatial task a vector representation might be more suitable. Figure 2.8: Examples of continuous (left) and categorical (right) raster. 2.2.1 An introduction to raster The raster package supports raster objects in R. It provides an extensive set of functions to create, read, export, manipulate and process raster datasets. Aside from general raster data manipulation, raster provides many low level functions that can form the basis to develop more advanced raster functionality. raster also lets you work on large raster datasets that are too large to fit into the main memory. In this case, raster provides the possibility to divide the raster into smaller chunks (rows or blocks), and processes these iteratively instead of loading the whole raster file into RAM (for more information, please refer to vignette(&quot;functions&quot;, package = &quot;raster&quot;). For the illustration of the raster concepts, we will use datasets from the spDataLarge package. It consists of a few raster and one vector datasets covering an area of the Zion National Park (Utah, USA). For example, srtm.tif is a digital elevation model of this area (for more details - see its documentation ?srtm) First of all, we would like to create a RasterLayer object named new_raster: library(spDataLarge) library(raster) raster_filepath = system.file(&quot;raster/srtm.tif&quot;, package = &quot;spDataLarge&quot;) new_raster = raster(raster_filepath) Typing the name of the raster into the console, will print out the raster header (extent, dimensions, resolution, CRS) and some additional information (class, data source name, summary of the raster values): new_raster #&gt; class : RasterLayer #&gt; dimensions : 463, 459, 212517 (nrow, ncol, ncell) #&gt; resolution : 73.7, 92.5 (x, y) #&gt; extent : 301929, 335757, 4111262, 4154089 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) #&gt; coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs #&gt; data source : /home/travis/R/Library/spDataLarge/raster/srtm.tif #&gt; names : srtm #&gt; values : 1050, 2895 (min, max) To access individual header information, you can use following commands: # dimensions (number of rows, number of columns, number of cells) dim(new_raster) #&gt; [1] 463 459 1 # spatial resolution res(new_raster) #&gt; [1] 73.7 92.5 # spatial extent extent(new_raster) #&gt; class : Extent #&gt; xmin : 301929 #&gt; xmax : 335757 #&gt; ymin : 4111262 #&gt; ymax : 4154089 # coordinate reference system crs(new_raster) #&gt; CRS arguments: #&gt; +proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m #&gt; +no_defs Note that in contrast to the sf package, raster only accepts the proj4string representation of the coordinate reference system. Sometimes it is important to know if all values of a raster are currently in memory or on disk. Find out with the inMemory() function: inMemory(new_raster) #&gt; [1] FALSE help(package = &quot;raster&quot;, topic = &quot;raster-package&quot;) returns a full list of all available raster functions. 2.2.2 Basic map making Similar to the sf package, raster also provides plot() methods for its own classes. plot(new_raster) Moreover, it is possible to plot a raster and overlay it with vector data. For this purpose, we need to read-in a vector dataset: vector_filepath = system.file(&quot;vector/zion.gpkg&quot;, package=&quot;spDataLarge&quot;) new_vector = st_read(vector_filepath) Our new object, new_vector, is a polygon representing the borders of Zion National Park (?zion). We can add the borders to the elevation map using the add argument of the plot(): plot(new_raster) plot(new_vector, add = TRUE) There are several different approaches to plot raster data in R: You can use spplot() to visualize several (such as spatiotemporal) layers at once. You can also do so with the rasterVis package which provides more advanced methods for plotting raster objects. Packages such as tmap, mapview and leaflet facilitate especially interactive mapping of both raster and vector objects. 2.2.3 Raster classes The RasterLayer class represents the simplest form of a raster object, and consists of only one layer. The easiest way to create a raster object in R is to read-in a raster file from disk or from a server. raster_filepath = system.file(&quot;raster/srtm.tif&quot;, package = &quot;spDataLarge&quot;) new_raster = raster(raster_filepath) The raster package support numerous drivers with the help of rgdal. To find out which drivers are available on your system, run raster::writeFormats() and rgdal::gdalDrivers(). Aside from reading in a raster, you can also create one from scratch. Running raster() creates an empty RasterLayer. Here, however, we will create manually a very simple raster. This should make it easy to understand how raster and related operations work. Our raster should consist of just three rows and columns centered around the null meridian and the equator (see xmn, xmx, ymn and ymx parameters). Additionally, we define a resolution of 0.5, which here corresponds to 0.5 degrees since the default proj4string of a raster object is WGS84. Finally, we set the values with the vals argument. Here, we just number the cells, that means we assign 1 to cell 1, 2 to cell 2, and finally 36 to cell 36. We know that there are 36 cells by multiplying six (rows) by six (columns). As we have seen above, setting raster values in R corresponds to a rowwise cell filling starting at the upper left corner. Consequently, the upper first row contains the values 1 to 6, the second row 7 to 12, and the last row 31 to 36. # creation of the RasterLayer object with a given number of columns and rows, and extent new_raster2 = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5, vals = 1:36) For still further ways of creating a raster object have a look at the help file - ?raster. Aside from RasterLayer, there are two additional classes: RasterBrick and RasterStack. Both can handle multiple layers, but differ regarding the number of supported file formats, type of internal representation and processing speed. A RasterBrick consists of multiple layers, which typically correspond to a multispectral satellite file. The brick() function creates a RasterBrick object. Usually, you provide it with a filename to a multilayer raster file but might also use another raster object and other spatial objects (see its help page for all supported formats). multilayer_raster_filepath = system.file(&quot;raster/landsat.tif&quot;, package=&quot;spDataLarge&quot;) r_brick = brick(multilayer_raster_filepath) r_brick #&gt; class : RasterBrick #&gt; dimensions : 1428, 1128, 1610784, 4 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) #&gt; resolution : 30, 30 (x, y) #&gt; extent : 301905, 335745, 4111245, 4154085 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) #&gt; coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=12 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 #&gt; data source : /home/travis/R/Library/spDataLarge/raster/landsat.tif #&gt; names : landsat.1, landsat.2, landsat.3, landsat.4 #&gt; min values : 7550, 6404, 5678, 5252 #&gt; max values : 19071, 22051, 25780, 31961 The nlayers function retrieves the number of layers stored in a Raster* object: nlayers(r_brick) #&gt; [1] 4 A RasterStack is similar to a RasterBrick in the sense that it consists also of multiple layers. More specifically, a RasterStack is a list of RasterLayer objects with the same extent and resolution. Hence, one way to create it is with the help of spatial objects already existing in R’s global environment. And again, one can simply specify a path to a file stored on disk. The possibility to create a RasterStack from a file stored on disk and an object residing in R’s global environment is one of the main differences compared to a RasterBrick. raster_on_disk = raster(r_brick, layer = 1) raster_in_memory = raster(xmn = 301905, xmx = 335745, ymn = 4111245, ymx = 4154085, res = 30) values(raster_in_memory) = sample(1:ncell(raster_in_memory)) crs(raster_in_memory) = crs(raster_on_disk) r_stack &lt;- stack(raster_in_memory, raster_on_disk) r_stack #&gt; class : RasterStack #&gt; dimensions : 1428, 1128, 1610784, 2 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) #&gt; resolution : 30, 30 (x, y) #&gt; extent : 301905, 335745, 4111245, 4154085 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) #&gt; coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=12 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 #&gt; names : layer, landsat.1 #&gt; min values : 1, 7550 #&gt; max values : 1610784, 19071 Another difference is that the processing time for RasterBrick objects should be usually shorter than for RasterStack objects. Note that operations on RasterBrick and RasterStack objects will typically return a RasterBrick. 2.3 Coordinate Reference Systems Vector and raster spatial data types share concepts intrinsic to spatial data. Perhaps the most important of these is the Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth (or other bodies). Coordinate system could be either projected or geographic (Figures 2.9 and 2.10). Geographic coordinate systems identify any location on the Earth’s surface using two values - longitude and latitude. The first one is an angle from the prime meridian plan and the second one is an angle from the equatorial plane to this location. Therefore, units of geographic coordinate systems are degrees. Projected coordinate systems are based on Cartesian coordinates and represent any area on a flat surface. Projected coordinate system needs to have an origin, x and y axes, and a linear unit of measure. Two main ways to describe CRS in R is an epsg code or a proj4string definition. Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. An epsg code is usually shorter, and therefore easier to remember. The code also refers to only one, well-defined coordinate reference system. On the other hand, a proj4string definition allows you more flexibility when it comes to specifying different parameters such as the projection type, the datum and the ellipsoid. This way you can specify many different projections, and modify existing ones. This makes the proj4string approach also more complicated16. epsg always points to exactly one particular CRS. Correspondingly, there is also only one possible proj4string for a specific epsg-code. In sf the CRS of an object can be retrieved using st_crs(): old_crs = st_crs(new_vector) # get CRS old_crs # print CRS #&gt; $epsg #&gt; [1] NA #&gt; #&gt; $proj4string #&gt; [1] &quot;+proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs&quot; #&gt; #&gt; attr(,&quot;class&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;crs&quot; In cases when a coordinate reference system (CRS) is missing or the wrong CRS is set, the st_set_crs() function can be used: new_vector = st_set_crs(new_vector, 4326) # set CRS #&gt; Warning: st_crs&lt;- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform #&gt; for that The warning message informs us that the st_set_crs() function do not transform data from one CRS to another. However, it can be done using st_transform(). More on that in chapter ??. Figure 2.9: Examples of projected (left) and geographic (right) coordinate systems for a vector data type. The projection() function can be use to access a CRS information from the Raster* object: projection(new_raster) #&gt; [1] &quot;+proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs&quot; Figure 2.10: Examples of projected (left) and geographic (right) coordinate systems for a raster data type 2.4 Units An important feature of CRSs is that they contain information about spatial units. Clearly it is vital to know whether a house’s measurements are in feet or meters, and the same applies to maps. It is good cartographic practice to add a scale bar onto maps to demonstrate the relationship between distances on the page or screen and distances on the ground. Likewise, it is important to formally specify the units in which the geometry data or pixels are measured to provide context, and ensure that subsequent calculations are done in context. A novel feature of geometry data in sf objects is that they have native support for units. This means that distance, area and other geometric calculations in sf return values that come with a units attribute, defined by the units package (Pebesma, Mailund, and Hiebert 2016). This is advantageous because it prevents confusion caused by the fact that different CRSs use different units (most use meters, some use feet). Furthermore, it also provides information on dimensionality, as illustrated by the following calculation which reports the area of Nigeria: nigeria = world[world$name_long == &quot;Nigeria&quot;, ] st_area(nigeria) #&gt; 9.05e+11 m^2 The result is in units of square meters (m2), showing a) that the result represents two-dimensional space and b) and that Nigeria is a large country! This information, stored as an attribute (which interested readers can discover with attributes(st_area(nigeria))) is advantageous for many reasons, for example it could feed into subsequent calculations such as population density. Reporting units prevents confusion. To take the Nigeria example, if the units remained unspecified, one could incorrectly assume that the units were in km2. To translate the huge number into a more digestible size, it is tempting to divide the results by a million (the number of square meters in a square kilometer): st_area(nigeria) / 1e6 #&gt; 905072 m^2 However, the result is incorrectly given again as square meters. The solution is to set the correct units with the units package: units::set_units(st_area(nigeria), km^2) #&gt; 905072 km^2 Units are of equal importance in the case of raster data. However, so far sf is the only spatial package that supports units, meaning that people working on raster data should approach changes in the units of analysis (e.g., converting pixel widths from imperial to decimal units) with care. The new_raster object (see above) uses a UTM projection with meters as units. Consequently, its resolution is also given in meters but you have to know it, since the res() function simply returns a numeric vector. res(new_raster) #&gt; [1] 73.7 92.5 If we used the WGS84 projection, the units would change. library(rgdal) repr = projectRaster(new_raster, crs = &quot;+init=epsg:4326&quot;) res(repr) #&gt; [1] 0.000831 0.000833 Again, the res() command gives back a numeric vector without any unit, forcing us to know that the unit of the WGS84 projection is decimal degrees. 2.5 Exercises What does the summary of the geometry column tell us about the world dataset, in terms of: The geometry type? How many countries there are? The coordinate reference system (CRS)? Using sf’s plot() command, create a map of Nigeria in context, building on the code that creates and plots Asia above (see Figure 2.5 for an example of what this could look like). Hint: this used the lwd, main and col arguments of plot(). Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line. Hint: border is an additional argument of plot() for sf objects. What does the lwd argument do in the plot() code that generates Figure 2.6. Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice. Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world. Read the raster/nlcd2011.tif file from the spDataLarge package. What kind of information can you get about the properties of this file? Create an empty RasterLayer object called my_raster with 10 columns and 10 rows, and resolution of 10 units. Assign random values between 0 and 10 to the new raster and plot it. References "],

A bus stop provides a simple example. In a spatial vector object its position would typically be represented by latitude and longitude coordinates (geometry data), in addition to its name. The name is an attribute of the feature (to use Simple Features terminology) that bears no relation to its geometry. Another example is the elevation value (attribute) for a specific grid cell in raster data. Unlike vector data, the raster data model stores the coordinate of the grid cell only indirectly: There is a less clear distinction between attribute and spatial information in raster data. Say, we are in the 3rd row and the 4th column of a raster matrix. To derive the corresponding coordinate, we have to move from the origin three cells in x-direction and four cells in y-direction with the cell resolution defining the distance for each x- and y-step. The raster header gives the matrix a spatial dimension which we need when plotting the raster or when we want to combine two rasters, think, for instance, of adding the values of one raster to another (see also next Chapter). This chapter focuses on non-geographic operations on vector and raster data. For vector data, we will introduce subsetting, aggregating and joining attribute data in the next section. Note that the corresponding functions also have a geographic equivalent. Sometimes you can even use the same functions for attribute and spatial operations. This is the case for subsetting as base R’s [ and tidyverse’s filter() let you also subset spatial data based on the spatial extent of another spatial object (see Chapter 4). Therefore the skills you learn here are cross-transferable which is also why this chapter lays the foundation for the next chapter (Chapter 4) which extends the here presented methods to the spatial world. Raster attribute data operations are covered in Section 3.3, which covers the creating continuous and categorical raster layers and extracting cell values from one layer and multiple layers (raster subsetting). Section 3.3.2 provides an overview of ‘global’ raster operations which can be used to characterize entire raster datasets. 3.2 Vector attribute manipulation Geographic vector data in R are well-support by sf, a class which extends the data.frame. Thus sf objects have one column per attribute variable (such as ‘name’) and one row per observation, or feature (e.g. per bus station). sf objects also have a special column to contain geometry data, usually named geometry. The geometry colum is special because it is a list-colum, which can contain multiple geographic entities (points, lines, polygons) per row. In Chapter 2 we saw how to perform generic methods such as plot() and summary() on sf objects. sf also provides methods that allow sf objects to behave like regular data frames: methods(class = &quot;sf&quot;) # methods for sf objects, first 12 shown #&gt; [1] aggregate cbind coerce #&gt; [4] initialize merge plot #&gt; [7] print rbind [ #&gt; [10] [[&lt;- $&lt;- show Many of these functions, including rbind() (for binding rows of data together) and $&lt;- (for creating new columns) were developed for data frames. A key feature of sf objects is that they store spatial and non-spatial data in the same way, as columns in a data.frame (the geometry column is typically called geometry). sf objects also support tibble and tbl classes used in the tidyverse, allowing ‘tidy’ data analysis workflows for spatial data. Thus sf enables the full power of R’s data analysis capabilities to be unleashed on geographic data. Before using these capabilities it’s worth re-capping how to discover the basic properties of vector data objects. Let’s start by using base R functions for to get a measure of the world dataset: dim(world) # it is a 2 dimensional object, with rows and columns #&gt; [1] 177 11 nrow(world) # how many rows? #&gt; [1] 177 ncol(world) # how many columns? #&gt; [1] 11 Our dataset contains ten non-geographic columns (and one geometry list-column) with almost 200 rows representing the world’s countries. Extracting the attribute data of an sf object is the same as removing its geometry: world_df = st_set_geometry(world, NULL) class(world_df) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; This can be useful if the geometry column causes problems, e.g., by occupying large amounts of RAM, or to focus the attention on the attribute data. For most cases, however, there is no harm in keeping the geometry column because non-spatial data operations on sf objects only change an object’s geometry when appropriate (e.g. by disolving borders between adjacent polygons following aggregation). This means that proficiency with attribute data in sf objects equates to proficiency with data frames in R. For many applications, the tidyverse package dplyr offers the most effective and intuitive approach of working with data frames, hence the focus on this approach in this section.17 3.2.1 Vector attribute subsetting Base R subsetting functions include [, subset() and $. dplyr subsetting functions include select(), filter(), and pull(). Both sets of functions preserve the spatial components of attribute data in sf objects. The [ operator can subset both rows and columns. You use indices to specify the elements you wish to extract from an object, e.g., object[i, j], with i and j typically being numbers or logical vectors — TRUEs and FALSEs — representing rows and columns (they can also be character strings, indicating row or column names). Leaving i or j empty returns all rows or columns, so world[1:5, ] returns the first five rows and all columns. The examples below demonstrate subsetting with base R. The results are not shown; check the results on your own computer: world[1:6, ] # subset rows by position world[, 1:3] # subset columns by position world[, c(&quot;name_long&quot;, &quot;lifeExp&quot;)] # subset columns by name A demonstration of the utility of using logical vectors for subsetting is shown in the code chunk below. This creates a new object, small_countries, containing nations whose surface area is smaller than 100,000 km2: sel_area = world$area_km2 &lt; 10000 summary(sel_area) # a logical vector #&gt; Mode FALSE TRUE #&gt; logical 170 7 small_countries = world[sel_area, ] The intermediary sel_object is a logical vector that shows that only seven countries match the query. A more concise command, that omits the intermediary object, generates the same result: small_countries = world[world$area_km2 &lt; 10000, ] Another the base R function subset() provides yet another way to achieve the same result: small_countries = subset(world, area_km2 &lt; 10000) You can use the $ operator to select a specific variable by its name. The result is a vector: world$name_long Base R functions are mature and widely used. However, the more recent dplyr approach has several advantages. It enables intuitive workflows. It’s fast, due to its C++ backend and database integration, important when working with big data. The main dplyr subsetting functions are select(), slice(), filter() and pull(). raster and dplyr packages have a function called select(). If both packages are loaded, this can generate error messages containing the text: unable to find an inherited method for function ‘select’ for signature ‘“sf”’. To avoid this error message, and prevent ambiguity, we use the long-form function name, prefixed by the package name and two colons (usually omitted from R scripts for concise code): dplyr::select(). select() selects columns by name or position. For example, you could select only two columns, name_long and pop, with the following command (note the geom column remains): world1 = dplyr::select(world, name_long, pop) names(world1) #&gt; [1] &quot;name_long&quot; &quot;pop&quot; &quot;geom&quot; select() also allows subsetting of a range of columns with the help of the : operator: # all columns between name_long and pop (inclusive) world2 = dplyr::select(world, name_long:pop) Omit specific columns with the - operator: # all columns except subregion and area_km2 (inclusive) world3 = dplyr::select(world, -subregion, -area_km2) Conveniently, select() lets you subset and rename columns at the same time, for example: world4 = dplyr::select(world, name_long, population = pop) names(world4) #&gt; [1] &quot;name_long&quot; &quot;population&quot; &quot;geom&quot; This is more concise than the base R equivalent: world5 = world[, c(&quot;name_long&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;)] # subset columns by name names(world5)[2] = &quot;population&quot; # rename column manually select() also works with ‘helper functions’ for advanced subsetting operations, including contains(), starts_with() and num_range() (see the help page with ?select for details). slice() is the row-equivalent of select(). The following code chunk, for example, selects the 3rd to 5th rows: slice(world, 3:5) filter() is dplyr’s equivalent of base R’s subset() function. It keeps only rows matching given criteria, e.g., only countries with a very high average of life expectancy: # Countries with a life expectancy more than 82 years world6 = filter(world, lifeExp &gt; 82) The standard set of comparison operators can be used in the filter() function, as illustrated in Table 3.1: Table 3.1: Table of comparison operators that result in boolean (TRUE/FALSE) outputs. Symbol Name == Equal to != Not equal to &gt;, &lt; Greater/Less than &gt;=, &lt;= Greater/Less than or equal &amp;, |, ! Logical operators: And, Or, Not A benefit of dplyr is its compatibility with the pipe operator %&gt;%. This ‘R pipe’, which takes its name from the Unix pipe | and is part of the magrittr package, enables expressive code by ‘piping’ the output of a previous command into the first argument of the next function. This allows chaining data analysis commands, with the data frame being passed from one function to the next. The dplyr function pull() extracts a single variable as a vector. This is illustrate below, in which the world dataset is subset by columns (name_long and continent) and the first five rows (result not shown). world7 = world %&gt;% dplyr::select(name_long, continent) %&gt;% slice(1:5) The above chunk shows how the pipe operator allows commands to be written in a clear order: the above run from top to bottom (line-by-line) and left to right. Without %&gt;% one would be forced to create intermediary objects or use nested function calls, e.g.: world8 = dplyr::select( slice(world, 1:5), name_long, continent) This generates the same result — verify this with identical(world7, world8) — in the same number of lines of code, but in a much more confusing way, starting with the function that is called last! The ‘right arrow’ -&gt; operator can be used to make the result be assigned at the end of a chaining process. There are additional advantages of pipes from a communication perspective: they encourage adding comments to self-contained functions and allow single lines commented-out without breaking the code. 3.2.2 Vector attribute aggregation Aggregation operations summarize datasets by a grouping variable, which can be either another attribute column or a spatial object (see Chapter ??). Imagine we would like to calculate the number of people per continent. Fortunately, our world dataset has the necessary ingredients, with the pop column containing the population per country and the grouping variable continent. In base R this can be done with aggregate() as follows: aggregate(pop ~ continent, FUN = sum, data = world, na.rm = TRUE) The result is a non-spatial data frame with eight rows, one per continent, and two columns (see Table 3.2 with results for the top 3 most populous continents). summarize() is the dplyr equivalent of aggregate(), which uses the function group_by() to create the grouping variable. The tidy equivalent of the aggregate() method is as follows: group_by(world, continent) %&gt;% summarize(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE)) This approach is flexible, allowing the resulting columns to be named. Further, omitting the grouping variable puts everything on in one group. This means summarize() can be used to calculate Earth’s total population (~7 billion) and number of countries: world %&gt;% summarize(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE), n_countries = n()) #&gt; pop n_countries #&gt; 1 7.21e+09 177 The result is a spatial data frame of class sf (only the non-spatial results are shown): the aggregation procedure dissolves boundaries within continental land masses. In the previous code chunk pop and n_countries are column names in the result. sum() and n() were the aggregating functions. Let’s combine what we’ve learned so far about dplyr by chaining together functions to find the world’s 3 most populous continents (with dplyr::n() ) and the number of countries they contain. The output of the following code is presented in Table 3.2): world %&gt;% st_set_geometry(value = NULL) %&gt;% select(pop, continent) %&gt;% group_by(continent) %&gt;% summarize(pop = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE), n_countries = n()) %&gt;% top_n(n = 3, wt = pop) Table 3.2: The top 3 most populous continents, and the number of countries in each. continent pop n_countries Africa 1.15e+09 51 Asia 4.31e+09 47 Europe 7.39e+08 39 3.2.3 Vector attribute joining Combining data from different sources is a common task in data preparation. Joins do this by combining tables based on a shared ‘key’ variable. dplyr has powerful functions for joining: left_join(), right_join(), inner_join(), full_join, semi_join() and anti_join(). These function names follow conventions used in the database language SQL (Grolemund and Wickham 2016, Chapter 13). Using them with sf objects is the focus of this section. dplyr join functions work the same on data frames and sf objects, the only important difference being the geometry list column. The result of data joins can be either an sf or data.frame object. Most joins involving spatial data will have an sf object as the first argument and a data.frame object as the second argument, resulting in a new sf object (the reverse order is also possible and will return a data.frame). We will focus on the commonly used left and inner joins, which use the same syntax as the other join types (see Grolemund and Wickham 2016 for more join types). The easiest way to understand the concept of joins is to show how they work with a smaller dataset. We will use an sf object north_america with country codes (iso_a2), names and geometries, as well as a data.frame object wb_north_america containing information about urban population and unemployment for three countries. Note that north_america contains data about Canada, Greenland and the United States but the World Bank dataset (wb_north_america) contains information about Canada, Mexico and the United States: north_america = world %&gt;% filter(subregion == &quot;Northern America&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::select(iso_a2, name_long) north_america$name_long #&gt; [1] &quot;Canada&quot; &quot;Greenland&quot; &quot;United States&quot; wb_north_america = worldbank_df %&gt;% filter(name %in% c(&quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;United States&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::select(name, iso_a2, urban_pop, unemploy = unemployment) We will use a left join to combine the two datasets. Left joins are the most commonly used operation for adding attributes to spatial data, as they return all observations from the left object (north_america) and the matched observations from the right object (wb_north_america) in new columns. Rows in the left object without matches in the right (Greenland in this case) result in NA values. To join two objects we need to specify a key. This is a variable (or a set of variables) that uniquely identifies each observation (row). The by argument of dplyr’s join functions lets you identify the key variable. In simple cases, a single, unique variable exist in both objects like the iso_a2 column in our example (you may need to rename columns with identifying information for this to work): left_join1 = north_america %&gt;% left_join(wb_north_america, by = &quot;iso_a2&quot;) This has created a spatial dataset with the new variables added. The utility of this is shown in Figure 3.1, which shows the unemployment rate (a World Bank variable) across the countries of North America. Figure 3.1: The unemployment rate (taken from World Bank statistics) in Canada and the United States to illustrate the utility of joining attribute data on to spatial datasets. It is also possible to join objects by different variables. Both of the datasets have variables with names of countries, but they are named differently. The north_america has a name_long column and the wb_north_america has a name column. In these cases a named vector, such as c(&quot;name_long&quot; = &quot;name&quot;), can specify the connection: left_join2 = north_america %&gt;% left_join(wb_north_america, by = c(&quot;name_long&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) names(left_join2) #&gt; [1] &quot;iso_a2.x&quot; &quot;name_long&quot; &quot;iso_a2.y&quot; &quot;urban_pop&quot; &quot;unemploy&quot; &quot;geom&quot; Note that the result contains two duplicated variables - iso_a2.x and iso_a2.y because both x and y objects have the column iso_a2. This can be solved by specifying all the keys: left_join3 = north_america %&gt;% left_join(wb_north_america, by = c(&quot;iso_a2&quot;, &quot;name_long&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) Joins also work when a data frame is the first argument. This keeps the geometry column but drops the sf class, returning a data.frame object. # keeps the geom column, but drops the sf class left_join4 = wb_north_america %&gt;% left_join(north_america, by = c(&quot;iso_a2&quot;)) class(left_join4) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; It is possible to convert a data frame with a geometry list column, such as left_join4, into an sf object with st_as_sf(), as follows: st_as_sf(left_join4). In contrast to left_join(), inner_join() keeps only observations from the left object (north_america) where there are matching observations in the right object (wb_north_america). All columns from the left and right object are still kept: inner_join1 = north_america %&gt;% inner_join(wb_north_america, by = c(&quot;iso_a2&quot;, &quot;name_long&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) inner_join1$name_long #&gt; [1] &quot;Canada&quot; &quot;United States&quot; 3.2.4 Creating attributes and removing spatial information Often, we would like to create a new column based on already existing columns. For example, we want to calculate population density for each country. For this we need to divide a population column, here pop, by an area column , here area_km2 with unit area in square km. Using base R, we can type: data(&quot;world&quot;) world_new = world # do not overwrite our original data world_new$pop_dens = world_new$pop / world_new$area_km2 Alternatively, we can use one of dplyr functions - mutate() or transmute(). mutate() adds new columns at the penultimate position in the sf object (the last one is reserved for the geometry): world %&gt;% mutate(pop_dens = pop / area_km2) The difference between mutate() and transmute() is that the latter skips all other existing columns (except for the sticky geometry column): world %&gt;% transmute(pop_dens = pop / area_km2) Existing columns could be also paste together using unite(). For example, we want to stick together continent and region_un columns into a new con_reg column. We could specify a separator to use between values and if input columns should be removed: world_unite = world %&gt;% unite(&quot;con_reg&quot;, continent:region_un, sep = &quot;:&quot;, remove = TRUE) The separate() function is the complement of the unite() function. Its role is to split one column into multiple columns using either a regular expression or character position. world_separate = world_unite %&gt;% separate(con_reg, c(&quot;continent&quot;, &quot;region_un&quot;), sep = &quot;:&quot;) Two helper functions, rename() and set_names can be used to change columns names. The first one, rename() replace an old name with a new one. For example, we want to change a name of column from name_long to name: world %&gt;% rename(name = name_long) set_names can be used to change names of many columns. In this function, we do not need to provide old names: new_names = c(&quot;ISO_A2&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Continent&quot;, &quot;Region&quot;, &quot;Subregion&quot;, &quot;Country_type&quot;, &quot;Area_in_km2&quot;, &quot;Population&quot;, &quot;Life_Expectancy&quot;, &quot;GDP_per_capita&quot;, &quot;geom&quot;) world %&gt;% set_names(new_names) It is important to note that the attribute data operations preserve the geometry of the simple features. As mentioned at the outset of the chapter, however, it can be useful to remove the geometry. Do do this, you have to explicitly remove it because sf explicitly makes the geometry column sticky. This behavior ensures that data frame operations do not accidentally remove the geometry column. Hence, an approach such as select(world, -geom) will be unsuccessful instead use st_set_geometry()18. world_data = world %&gt;% st_set_geometry(NULL) class(world_data) #&gt; [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; More details are provided in the help pages (which can be accessed via ?summarize and vignette(package = &quot;dplyr&quot;) and Chapter 5 of R for Data Science. 3.3 Manipulating raster objects In contrast to the vector data model underlying simple features (which represents points, lines and polygons as discrete entities in space), raster data represent continuous surfaces. This section shows how raster objects work, by creating them from scratch, building on section 2.2.1. Because of their unique structure, subsetting and other operations on raster datasets work in a different way, as demonstrated in section 3.3.1. The following code recreates the raster dataset used in section 2.2.3, the result of which is illustrated in Figure 3.2. This demonstrates how the raster() function works to create an example raster named elev (representing elevations). library(raster) elev = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5, vals = 1:36) The result is a raster object with 6 rows and 6 columns (specified by the nrow and ncol arguments), and minimum and a minimum and maximum spatial extent (specified by xmn, xmx and equivalent arguments for the y axis). The vals argument sets the values that each cell contains: numeric data ranging from 1 to 36 in this case. Raster objects can also contain categorical values of class logical or factor variables in R. The following code creates a raster representing grain sizes (Figure 3.2): grain_order = c(&quot;clay&quot;, &quot;silt&quot;, &quot;sand&quot;) grain_char = sample(grain_order, 36, replace = TRUE) grain_fact = factor(grain_char, levels = grain_order) grain = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5, vals = grain_fact) raster objects cannot contain values of class ‘character’. For this reason the function factor() is used in the preceding code chunk. The levels argument was used to create an ordered factor: clay &lt; silt &lt; sand in terms of grain size, so the levels are provided in this order. raster objects represent categorical varibles as integers, so grain[1, 1] returns a number that represents a unique identifiers, rather than “clay”, “silt” or “sand”. The raster object stores the corresponding look-up table or “Raster Attribute Table” (RAT) as a data frame in a new slot named attributes, which can be viewed with ratify(grain) (see ?ratify() for more information). Use the function levels() to retrieve the attribute table and add additional factor values: levels(grain)[[1]] = cbind(levels(grain)[[1]], wetness = c(&quot;wet&quot;, &quot;moist&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;)) levels(grain) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; ID VALUE wetness #&gt; 1 1 clay wet #&gt; 2 2 silt moist #&gt; 3 3 sand dry This behaviour demonstrates that raster cells can only possess one value, an identifier which can be used to look up the attributes in the corresponding attribute table (stored in a slot named attributes). This is illustrated in command below, which returns the grain size and wetness of cell IDs 1, 12 and 36, we can run: factorValues(grain, grain[c(1, 12, 36)]) #&gt; VALUE wetness #&gt; 1 sand dry #&gt; 2 clay wet #&gt; 3 silt moist Figure 3.2: Raster with numberic values (left) and a raster with categorical values (right). 3.3.1 Raster subsetting Raster subsetting is done with the base R operator [, which accepts a variety of inputs: row-column indexing cell IDs coordinates another raster object The latter two represent spatial subsetting (see the next chapter). The first two subsetting options are demonstrated in the commands below — both return the value of the top left pixel in the raster object elev (results not shown): # row 1, column 1 elev[1, 1] # cell ID 1 elev[1] To extract all values or complete rows, you can use values() and getValues(). For multi-layered raster objects stack or brick, this will return the cell value(s) for each layer. For example, stack(elev, grain)[1] returns a matrix with one row and two columns — one for each layer. For multi-layer raster objects another way to subset is with raster::subset(), which extracts layers from a raster stack or brick. The [[ and $ operators can also be used. Cell values can be modified by overwriting existing values in conjunction with a subsetting operation. The following code chunk, for example, sets the upper left cell of elev to 0: elev[1, 1] = 0 elev[] #&gt; [1] 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 #&gt; [24] 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Leaving the square brackets empty is a shortcut version of values() for retrieving all values of a raster. Multiple cells can also be modified in this way: elev[1, 1:2] = 0 3.3.2 Summarizing raster objects raster contains functions for extracting descriptive statistics for entire rasters. Printing a raster object to the console by default, by typing its name, returns minimum and maximum values of a raster. summary() provides common descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, interquartile range and number of NAs). Further summary operations such as the standard deviation (see below) or custom summary statistics can be calculated with cellStats(). cellStats(elev, sd) Note: if you provide the summary() and cellStats() functions with a raster stack or brick object, they will summarize each layer separately. Try summary(brick(elev, grain)). Nothing stops us from visualizing descriptive raster statistics. We can manually retrieving raster values with the help of the values() and getValues() function, and putting their output into any plot() function we like. Or we can make use of the boxplot(), density(), hist() and pairs() methods for raster objects. Descriptive raster statistics belong to the so-called global raster operations. These and other typical raster processing operations are part of the map algebra scheme which we will get to know better in the next chapter. Some function names clash between packages (e.g., select, as discussed in a previous note). In addition to not loading packages by referring to functions verbosely (e.g., dplyr::select()) another way to prevent function names clashes is by unloading the offending package with detach(). The following command, for example, unloads the raster package (this can also be done in the package tab in the right-bottom pane in RStudio): detach(“package:raster”, unload = TRUE, force = TRUE). The force argument makes sure that the package will be detached even if other packages depend on it. This, however, may lead to a restricted usability of packages depending on the detached package, and is therefore not recommended. 3.4 Exercises For these exercises we will use the us_states and us_states_df datasets from the spData package: library(spData) data(us_states) data(us_states_df) us_states is a spatial object (of class sf), containing geometry and a few attributes (including name, region, area, and population) of states within the contiguous United States. us_states_df is a data frame (of class data.frame) containing the name and additional variables (including median income and poverty level, for years 2010 and 2015) of US states, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. The data comes from the US Census Bureau, and is documented in ?us_states and ?us_states_df. Create a new object called us_states_name that contains only the NAME column from the us_states object. What is the class of the new object? Select columns from the us_states object which contain population data. Obtain the same result using a different command (bonus: try to find three ways of obtaining the same result). Hint: try to use helper functions, such as contains or starts_with from dplyr (see ?contains). Find all states with the following characteristics (bonus find and plot them): belong to the Midwest region. belong to the West region, have an area below 250,000 km2 and in 2015 a population greater than 5,000,000 residents (hint: you may need to use the function units::set_units() or as.numeric()). belong to the South region, had an area larger than 150,000 km2 or a total population in 2015 larger than 7,000,000 residents. What was the total population in 2015 in the us_states dataset? What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015? How many states are there in each region? What was the minimum and maximum total population in 2015 in each region? What was the total population in 2015 in each region? Add variables from us_states_df to us_states, and create a new object called us_states_stats. What function did you use and why? Which variable is the key in both datasets? What is the class of the new object? us_states_df has two more variables than us_states. How you can find them? (hint: try to use the dplyr::anti_join function) What was the population density in 2015 in each state? What was the population density in 2010 in each state? How much has population density changed between 2010 and 2015 in each state? Calculate the change in percentages and map them. Change the columns names in us_states to lowercase. (Hint: helper functions - tolower() and colnames() may help). Using us_states and us_states_df create a new object called us_states_sel. The new object should have only two variables - median_income_15 and geometry. Change the name of the median_income_15 column to Income. Calculate the change in median income between 2010 and 2015 for each state. Bonus: what was the minimum, average and maximum median income in 2015 for each region? What is the region with the largest increase of the median income? Create a raster from scratch with nine rows and columns and a resolution of 0.5 decimal degrees (WGS84). Fill it with random numbers. Extract the values of the four corner cells. What is the most common class of our example raster grain (hint: modal())? Plot the histogram and the boxplot of the data(dem, package = &quot;RQGIS&quot;) raster. Now attach also data(ndvi, package = &quot;RQGIS&quot;). Create a raster stack using dem and ndvi, and make a pairs() plot References "],
["spatial-data-operations.html", "4 Spatial data operations Prerequisites 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Spatial operations on vector data 4.3 Spatial operations on raster data 4.4 Exercises", " 4 Spatial data operations Prerequisites This chapter requires the packages tidyverse, sf and raster. library(sf) library(tidyverse) library(raster) It also relies on spData, which loads the world dataset used in examples in the chapter: library(spData) 4.1 Introduction Spatial operations are an important component of any geospatial software and vital for many applications involving spatial data. There are clear overlaps between spatial and non-spatial operations. Common spatial attribute data processing tasks include spatial subsetting (as we will see in section 4.2.1 and section 3.3.1), joining and aggregation (see sections 4.2.3, 4.3.2, for example). In the case of vector data, each of these spatial operations has a non-spatial equivalent, as demonstrated in section 3.2 in the previous chapter. By contrast, subsetting is the only spatial raster operation we present in this chapter (section 4.3) which also has a non-spatial counterpart. Nevertheless, spatial raster and vector operations share many similarities, at least in terms of functionality though the internal processing is completely different. Some operations covered in this chapter are unique to spatial data. A variety of topological relations can be used to subset/join vector geometries (by default sf uses the catch-all intersects but other relations such as within can be very useful), a topic that is explored in section 4.2.2. New geometry data can be created by modifying existing spatial objects, using operations such as ‘buffer’ and ‘clip’, described in sections ?? and 4.3.2. Another unique aspect of spatial objects is distance. All features are related to each other in geographic space, and distance calculations resolve which spatial features are nearer or further away from a given point or each other (see sections 4.2.6 and 4.3.2). The final section in this chapter additionally explores how to align two raster objects in case their headers mismatch (section 4.3.4). This is especially important if we want to merge several rasters into one bigger raster or if we want to use several mismatching raster layers for algebraic operations. It is important to note that spatial operations that use two spatial objects rely on both objects having the same coordinate reference system, a topic that was introduced in 2.3 and which will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6. 4.2 Spatial operations on vector data 4.2.1 Spatial subsetting Spatial subsetting is the process of selecting only those features of a spatial object that in some way intersect with another spatial object. Note that ‘intersect’ in this context has a precise meaning: if y is used to subset features in a ‘target’ object of x, any features in x that touch, overlap or are within features in y will be selected. Intersect is the default operation for spatial subsetting but others can be used using the op = argument.19 There are nine well-defined operations that can be used for spatial subsetting, covered in section 4.2.2. This may seem daunting but the good news is that you do not have to learn all of them separately: after you understand how to spatially subset objects that intersect another (via st_intersects()) it is easy to subset based on other types of spatial operation such as st_touches(), st_crosses() and st_within(). For this reason now we focus only on one of the spatial subsetting operations. We use st_intersects() because it the default when subsetting with [, and is a useful as a ‘catch all’ that identifies all types of spatial relations. In general terms, spatial subsetting is simply the spatial equivalent of attribute subsetting. As with attribute subsetting, spatial subsetting is a binary operation: an object is either selected or not. Following the structure of section 3.2.1, we start with base methods before describing how to do it in the tidyverse. To introduce spatial vector subsetting operations we will use countries in Africa. We will apply attribute subsetting to the world dataset (see previous chapter):20 africa_wgs = world[world$continent == &quot;Africa&quot;, ] To further prepare the input data, we will reproject the data to the coordinate reference system (CRS) 32630, its EPSG code (explained in Chapter 6): africa = st_transform(africa_wgs, crs = 32630) We can also use the [ operator for Spatial subsetting. The difference is that we use another spatial object inside the square brackets instead of an integer or logical vector. This is a concise and consistent syntax, as shown in the next code chunk. Let’s test it with a hypothetical scenario: we want to subset all countries within 20 degrees of the point where the equator (where latitude = 0 degrees) intersects the prime meridian (longitude = 0 degrees), as illustrated in Figure 4.1. The subsetting object is created below. Note that this must have the same CRS as the target object (set with the crs argument): center = st_sf(geometry = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 0)), crs = 4326)) buff = st_buffer(x = center, dist = 20) buff = st_transform(buff, 32630) Figure 4.1: Hypothetical subsetting scenario: select all countries which intersect with a circle of 20 degrees in radius around planet Earth. Figure created with the globe package. The data to be subset, or ‘target layer’, is the africa object created above, which has a projected CRS (32630). Subsequently, spatial subsetting can be done with a single, concise command: africa_buff = africa[buff, ] If we were using geographic (‘lon/lat’) data the previous command would have emitted a message warning about assuming planar coordinates. This is because spatial operations (especially distance and area calculations) cannot be assumed to be accurate in a geographic (longitude/latitude) CRS. In this case one could justify the use of a lon/lat CRS: the data is close to the equator where there is least distortion caused by the curvature of the earth. It is good practice to reproject spatial datasets before performing spatial operations on them. The spatial subsetting clearly worked: only countries intersecting with the giant circle are returned (Figure 4.2): plot(africa_buff[&quot;pop&quot;]) plot(buff, add = TRUE) Figure 4.2: Subset of the africa data selected based on their intersection with a circle 20 degrees in radius with a center point at 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude. Note that countries that just touch the giant circle are selected such as Algeria (the large country at the north of plot). st_relates() includes countries that only touch (but are not within or overlapping with) the selection object. Other spatial subsetting operations such as st_within() are more conservative, as shown in section 4.2.2. Before we progress to explore the differences between different spatial subsetting operations, it is worth seeing alternative ways to achieve the same result, to deepen understanding of what is going on ‘under the hood’ (which in turn is vital for developing advanced geocomputation applications). The second way to reproduce the subsetting operation illustrated in Figure 4.2 simply involves expanding the operation over 2 lines: sel_buff = st_intersects(x = africa, y = buff, sparse = FALSE) africa_buff2 = africa[sel_buff, ] The third way is essentially the same as the second, but uses the filter() function introduced in section 3.2.1, forming the foundations of a ‘tidy’ spatial data analysis workflow. If you already use dplyr for data manipulation, this way should seem familiar: africa_buff3 = filter(africa, sel_buff) How can we be sure that the results are the same for the three subsetting operations? We can test them as follows: identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff2) #&gt; [1] TRUE identical(x = africa_buff, y = africa_buff3) #&gt; [1] FALSE The reason that the third spatially subset object (africa_buff3) is not identical is that dplyr changes the row names: head(row.names(africa_buff)) #&gt; [1] &quot;2&quot; &quot;14&quot; &quot;15&quot; &quot;27&quot; &quot;32&quot; &quot;33&quot; head(row.names(africa_buff3)) #&gt; [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; If the row names are re-set, the objects become identical: attr(africa_buff3, &quot;row.names&quot;) = attr(x = africa_buff, &quot;row.names&quot;) identical(africa_buff, africa_buff3) #&gt; [1] TRUE This discarding of row names is not something that is specific to spatial data, as illustrated in the code chunk below. dplyr discards row names by design. For further discussion of this decision, and some controversy, see the (closed) issue #366 in the package’s issue tracker. row.names(africa[africa$subregion == &quot;Northern Africa&quot;, ]) #&gt; [1] &quot;46&quot; &quot;48&quot; &quot;94&quot; &quot;100&quot; &quot;138&quot; &quot;140&quot; &quot;162&quot; row.names(filter(africa, subregion == &quot;Northern Africa&quot;)) #&gt; [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; 4.2.2 Topological relations a1 = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-1, -1), c(1, -1), c(1, 1), c(-1, -1)))) a2 = st_polygon(list(rbind(c(2, 0), c(2, 2), c(3, 2), c(3, 0), c(2, 0)))) a = st_sfc(a1, a2) b1 = a1 * 0.5 b2 = a2 * 0.4 + c(1, 0.5) b = st_sfc(b1, b2) l1 = st_linestring(x = matrix(c(0, 3, -1, 1), , 2)) l2 = st_linestring(x = matrix(c(-1, -1, -0.5, 1), , 2)) l = st_sfc(l1, l2) p = st_multipoint(x = matrix(c(0.5, 1, -1, 0, 1, 0.5), , 2)) plot(a, border = &quot;red&quot;, axes = TRUE) plot(b, border = &quot;green&quot;, add = TRUE) plot(l, add = TRUE) plot(p, add = TRUE) Equals: st_equals(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Contains: st_contains(a, b, sparse = FALSE) st_contains_properly(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Covers: st_covers(a, b, sparse = FALSE) st_covered_by(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Within: st_within(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Overlaps: st_overlaps(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Intersects: st_intersects(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Disjoint: st_disjoint(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Touches: st_touches(a, b, sparse = FALSE) Crosses: st_crosses(a, b, sparse = FALSE) DE9-IM - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM st_relate(a, b, sparse = FALSE) 4.2.3 Spatial joining and aggregation Joining two non-spatial datasets relies on a shared ‘key’ variable, as described in section 3.2.3. Spatial data joining applies the same concept, but instead relies on shared areas of geographic space. As with attribute data joining adds a new column to the target object (the argument x in joining functions) from a source object (y). The process is illustrated in Figure 4.3, which shows a target object (the world dataset, left) being joined to a source dataset (the three most populous cities of the world), resulting in a new attribute being added to the world dataset (right). urb = urban_agglomerations %&gt;% filter(year == 2020) %&gt;% top_n(n = 3, wt = population_millions) asia = world %&gt;% filter(continent == &quot;Asia&quot;) joined = st_join(x = asia, y = urb) joined[!is.na(joined$population_millions), ] #&gt; Simple feature collection with 3 features and 19 fields #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: 68.17665 ymin: 7.965535 xmax: 145.5431 ymax: 53.4588 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs #&gt; iso_a2 name_long continent region_un subregion type #&gt; 8 CN China Asia Asia Eastern Asia Country #&gt; 13 IN India Asia Asia Southern Asia Sovereign country #&gt; 18 JP Japan Asia Asia Eastern Asia Sovereign country #&gt; area_km2 pop lifeExp gdpPercap index year rank_order country_code #&gt; 8 9409832 1.36e+09 75.8 12759 423 2020 3 156 #&gt; 13 3142892 1.30e+09 68.0 5392 422 2020 2 356 #&gt; 18 404620 1.27e+08 83.6 37365 421 2020 1 392 #&gt; country_or_area city_code urban_agglomeration note population_millions #&gt; 8 China 20656 Shanghai 5 27.1 #&gt; 13 India 21228 Delhi 17 29.3 #&gt; 18 Japan 21671 Tokyo 1 38.3 #&gt; geom #&gt; 8 MULTIPOLYGON (((110.3391878... #&gt; 13 MULTIPOLYGON (((77.83745079... #&gt; 18 MULTIPOLYGON (((134.6384281... Figure 4.3: Illustration of a spatial join: the populations of the world’s 3 largest agglomerations joined onto their respective countries. This operation is also know as spatial overlay. st_join() performs by default a left join (see chapter 3.2.3, but you can change this to an inner join operation. Another default of st_join() is to intersect the two provided layers. Of course, you can use any other topological operations we have already encountered above such as st_within() or or st_touches() (please refer also to the help page of st_join(). In the example above, we have added features of a point layer to a polygon layer. Please note that there might be multiple point matches for one polygon. Had we chosen to select the four (instead of three) most populous cities in the world, two of them would have belonged to China (Shanghai and Beijing, give it a try yourself). In such a case st_join() simply adds a new row. In our example we would end up with two polygons representing China. 4.2.3.1 Non-overlapping joins 4.2.4 Aggregating or dissolving In the subsequent sections, we will present spatial operations that also act on and modify the underlying geometry, namely aggregating (dissolving) and clipping operations. Like attribute data aggregation, covered in section 3.2.2, spatial data aggregation (also known as dissolving polygons) can be a way of condensing data. Aggregated data show some statistic about a variable (typically mean average or total) in relation to some kind of grouping variable. For attribute data aggregation the grouping variable is another variable, typically one with few unique values relative to the number of rows. The REGION variable in the us_states dataset is a good example: there are only four subregions but 49 states (excluding Hawaii and Alaska). In section 3.2.2 we have already seen how attribute aggregation process condensed the world dataset down into only eight rows. Spatial data aggregation is the same conceptually but in addition to aggregating the attribute data, it dissolves the underlying polygons. Here, we want to aggregate the state population into regions. This means that we not only end up with four rows but also with four polygons (out of 49 in the beginning). As with spatial subsetting, spatial aggregation operations work by extending existing functions: regions = aggregate(x = us_states[, &quot;total_pop_15&quot;], by = list(us_states$REGION), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(us_states[, &quot;total_pop_15&quot;], main = &quot;US states&quot;) plot(regions[, &quot;total_pop_15&quot;], main = &quot;US regions&quot;) Of course, there is also spatial tidyverse counterpart. You can achieve the same with: group_by(us_states, REGION) %&gt;% summarize(sum(pop = total_pop_15, na.rm = TRUE)) buff_agg = aggregate(x = africa[, &quot;pop&quot;], by = buff, FUN = sum) The result, buff_agg, is a spatial object with the same geometry as by (the circular buffer in this case) but with an additional variable, pop reporting summary statistics for all features in x that intersect with by (the total population of the countries that touch the buffer in this case). Plotting the result (with plot(buff_agg)) shows that the operation does not really make sense: Figure 4.4 shows a population of over half a billion people mostly located in a giant circle floating off the west coast of Africa! Figure 4.4: Result of spatial aggregation showing the total population of countries that intersect with a large circle whose center lies at 0 degrees longitude and latitude. The results of the spatial aggregation exercise presented in Figure 4.4 are unrealistic for three reasons: People do not live in the sea (the geometry of the aggregating object is not appropriate for the geometry target object). This method would ‘double count’ countries whose borders cross aggregating polygons when multiple, spatially contiguous, features are used as the aggregating object. It is wrong to assume that all the people living in countries that touch the buffer reside within it (the default spatial operator st_intersects() is too ‘greedy’). The most extreme example of this is Algeria, the most northerly country selected: the spatial aggregation operation assumes that all 39 million Algerian citizens reside in the tiny southerly tip that is within the circular buffer. A number of methods can be used to overcome these issues, and generate a more realistic population attributed to the circular buffer illustrated in Figure 4.4. The simplest of these is to convert the country polygons into points representing their geographic centroids before aggregation, covered in section ??. This would ensure that any spatially contiguous aggregating object covering the target object (the Earth in this case) would result in the same total: there would be no double counting. The estimated total population residing within the study area would be more realistic if geographic centroids were used. (The centroid of Algeria, for example, is far outside the aggregating buffer.) Except in cases where the number of target features per aggregating feature is very large, or where the aggregating object is spatially congruent with the target (covered in section 4.2.4.1), using centroids can also lead to errors due to boundary effects: imagine a buffer that covers a large area but contains no centroids. These issues can be tackled when aggregating areal target data with areal interpolation. 4.2.4.1 Spatial congruence and areal interpolation Spatial congruence is an important concept related to spatial aggregation. An aggregating object object (which we will refer to as y, representing the buffer object in the previous section) is congruent with the target object (x, representing the countries in the previous section) if the two objects have shared borders. Often this is the case for administrative boundary data, whereby the larger units (e.g., Middle Layer Super Output Areas in the UK or districts in many other European countries) are composed of many smaller units (Output Areas in this case, see ons.gov.uk for further details or municipalities in many other European countries). Incongruent aggregating objects, by contrast, do not share common borders with the target (Qiu, Zhang, and Zhou 2012). This is problematic for spatial aggregation (and other spatial operations) illustrated in Figure 4.5. Areal interpolation can help to alleviate this issue. It helps to transfer data from one set of areal units to another. A number of algorithms have been developed for areal interpolation, including area weighted and pycnophylactic interpolation methods task (Tobler 1979). Figure 4.5: Illustration of congruent (left) and incongruent (right) areal units. The simplest useful method for spatial interpolation is area weighted spatial interpolation. This is implemented in st_interpolate_aw(), as demonstrated below: buff_agg_aw = st_interpolate_aw(x = africa[&quot;pop&quot;], to = buff, extensive = TRUE) #&gt; Warning in st_interpolate_aw(x = africa[&quot;pop&quot;], to = buff, extensive = #&gt; TRUE): st_interpolate_aw assumes attributes are constant over areas of x Instead of simply aggregating, this procedure additionally applies a weight, in this case simply the area. For instance, if the intersection of our buffer and a country is 100 000 km2 but the country has 1 mio square kilometers and 1 mio inhabitants, our result will obtain just a tenth of total population, in this case 100 000 inhabitants. 4.2.5 Clipping Spatial clipping is a form of spatial subsetting that involves changes to the geometry columns of at least some of the affected features. Clipping can only apply to features more complex than points: lines, polygons and their ‘multi’ equivalents. To illustrate the concept we will start with a simple example: two overlapping circles with a centerpoint 1 unit away from each other and radius of 1: b = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points b = st_buffer(b, dist = 1) # convert points to circles l = c(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) plot(b) text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) # add text Figure 4.6: Overlapping circles. Imagine you want to select not one circle or the other, but the space covered by both x and y. This can be done using the function st_intersection(), illustrated using objects named x and y which represent the left and right-hand circles: x = b[1] y = b[2] x_and_y = st_intersection(x, y) plot(b) plot(x_and_y, col = &quot;lightgrey&quot;, add = TRUE) # color intersecting area The subsequent code chunk demonstrate how this works for all combinations of the ‘Venn’ diagram representing x and y, inspired by Figure 5.1 of the book R for Data Science (Grolemund and Wickham 2016). Figure 4.7: Spatial equivalents of logical operators. To illustrate the relationship between subsetting and clipping spatial data, we will subset points that cover the bounding box of the circles x and y in Figure 4.7. Some points will be inside just one circle, some will be inside both and some will be inside neither. To generate the points will use a function not yet covered in this book, st_sample(). There are two different ways to subset points that fit into combinations of the circles: via clipping and logical operators. But first we must generate some points. We will use the simple random sampling strategy to sample from a box representing the extent of x and y, using the code below to generate the situation plotted in Figure 4.8: bb = st_bbox(st_union(x, y)) pmat = matrix(c(bb[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 1, 2)]), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) box = st_polygon(list(pmat)) set.seed(2017) p = st_sample(x = box, size = 10) plot(box) plot(x, add = TRUE) plot(y, add = TRUE) plot(p, add = TRUE) text(x = c(-0.5, 1.5), y = 1, labels = l) Figure 4.8: Randomly distributed points within the bounding box enclosing circles x and y. 4.2.6 Distance relations st_distance(a, b) 4.3 Spatial operations on raster data This section builds on 3.3, which highlights various basic methods for manipulating raster datasets, to demonstrate more advanced and explicitly spatial raster operations, and uses the same object elev and grain. 4.3.1 Spatial subsetting In the previous chapter (section 3.3) we have already learned how to subset raster datasets using cell IDs and matrix indexing. Naturally, we can subset rasters also with the help of coordinates and spatial objects. To use coordinates for subsetting, we have to ‘translate’ them into the corresponding cell ID(s) or by using the extract() command. This operation is also known as extracting values/attributes to points. # point within the top left pixel elev[cellFromXY(elev, xy = c(-1.5, 1.5))] # the same as extract(elev, data.frame(x = -1.5, y = 1.5)) The cellFromXY() and the extract() command accept also a SpatialPoints or SpatialPointsDataFrame object (though not an sf object). We can also use a raster object to subset another raster object (Figure 4.9 left panel). clip = raster(nrow = 3, ncol = 3, res = 0.3, xmn = 0.9, xmx = 1.8, ymn = -0.45, ymx = 0.45, vals = rep(1, 9)) elev[clip] #&gt; [1] 18 24 # we can also use extract # extract(elev, extent(clip)) Basically, this amounts to retrieving the values of the first raster (here: elev) falling within the extent of a second raster (here: clip). To retrieve a spatial output, we can tell R to keep the matrix structure. This will return the two output values as a raster object. elev[clip, drop = FALSE] #&gt; class : RasterLayer #&gt; dimensions : 2, 1, 2 (nrow, ncol, ncell) #&gt; resolution : 0.5, 0.5 (x, y) #&gt; extent : 1, 1.5, -0.5, 0.5 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) #&gt; coord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 #&gt; data source : in memory #&gt; names : layer #&gt; values : 18, 24 (min, max) For the same operation we can also use the intersect() and crop() command. Figure 4.9: Subsetting raster values with the help of another raster (left). Raster mask (middle). Output of masking a raster. Frequently, however, we have two rasters with the same extent and resolution where one raster object serves as a mask (Figure 4.9 middle and right panel). In these cases intersect() and crop() are of little use. Instead we can use the [ again or the mask() and overlay() commands: rmask = raster(nrow = 6, ncol = 6, res = 0.5, xmn = -1.5, xmx = 1.5, ymn = -1.5, ymx = 1.5, vals = sample(c(FALSE, TRUE), 36, replace = TRUE)) elev[rmask, drop = FALSE] # using the mask command mask(elev, rmask, maskvalue = TRUE) # using overlay # first we replace FALSE by NA rmask[rmask == FALSE] = NA # then we retrieve the maximum values overlay(elev, rmask, fun = &quot;max&quot;) In the code chunk above, we have created a mask object called rmask randomly setting its values to FALSE and TRUE. Next we only want to keep those values of elev which are TRUE in rmask, or expressed differently, we want to mask elev with rmask. These operations are in fact Boolean local operations since we compare cell-wise two rasters. The next subsection explores these and related operations in more detail. 4.3.2 Map algebra Map algebra makes raster processing really fast. This is because raster datasets only implicitly store coordinates. To derive the coordinate of a specific cell, we have to calculate it using its matrix position and the raster resolution and origin. For the processing, however, the geographic position of a cell is barely relevant as long as we make sure that the cell position is still the same after the processing (one-to-one locational correspondence). Additionally, if two or more raster datasets share the same extent, projection and the resolution, one could treat them as matrices for the processing. This is exactly what map algebra is doing. First, it checks the headers of the rasters on which to perform any algebraic operation, and only if they correspondent to each other, the processing goes on. And secondly, map algebra retains the so-called one-to-one locational correspondence. This is where it substantially differs from matrix algebra which changes positions when for example multiplying or dividing matrices. Map algebra (or cartographic modeling) divides raster operations into four subclasses (Tomlin 1990), with each of them either working on one or several grids simultaneously: Local or per-cell operations. Focal or neighborhood operations. Most often the output cell value is the result of a 3 x 3 input cell block. Zonal operations are similar to focal operations but instead of a predefined neighborhood, classes, which can take on any, i.e., also an irregular size and shape, are the basis for calculations. Global or per-raster operations, that means the output cell derives its value potentially from one or several entire rasters This classification scheme uses basically the number of cells involved in a processing step as distinguishing feature. Of course, one can classify raster operations based on other characteristics such as discipline. Think, for instance, of terrain, hydrological analysis or image classifications. In the following paragraphs, we will explain each of the four map algebra operations by example. Local operations comprise all cell-by-cell operations in one or several layers. A good example is the classification of intervals of numeric values into groups such as grouping a digital elevation model into low (class 1), middle (class 2) and high elevations (class 3). Using the reclassify() command, we need first to construct a reclassification matrix, where the first column corresponds to the lower and the second column to the upper end of the class. The third column represents the new value for the specified ranges in column one and two. Here, we assign the raster values in the ranges 0–12, 12–24 and 24–36 are reclassified to take values 1, 2 and 3, respectively. rcl = matrix(c(0, 12, 1, 12, 24, 2, 24, 36, 3), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) recl = reclassify(elev, rcl = rcl) Raster algebra is another classical use case of local operations. This includes adding, subtracting and squaring two rasters. Raster algebra also allows logical operations such as finding all raster cells that are greater than a specific value (5 in our example below). The raster package allows all these operations in a way natural to R users. Please see the Raster-vignette for a more detailed description on algebraic operations (vignette(&quot;Raster&quot;, package = &quot;raster&quot;)). elev + elev elev^2 log(elev) elev &gt; 5 Instead of arithmetic operators, you can also use the calc() and overlay() functions. These functions are more efficient. So you should use them if you have to process large raster datasets. Additionally, they let you directly store an output file. The calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the most famous local, i.e. pixel-by-pixel, raster operations. It ranges between - 1 and 1 with positive values indicating the presence of living plants (mostly &gt; 0.2). To calculate the NDVI, one uses the red and near-infrared bands of remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel imagery) exploiting the fact that vegetation absorbs light heavily in the visible light spectrum, and especially in the red channel, while reflecting it in the near-infrared spectrum. \\[ \\begin{split} NDVI&amp;= \\frac{\\text{NIR} - \\text{Red}}{\\text{NIR} + \\text{Red}}\\\\ \\end{split} \\] where NIR = near infrared channel Red = red channel Predictive mapping is another interesting application of local raster operations. The response variable correspond to measured or observed points in space, for example, species richness, the presence of landslides, tree disease or crop yield. Consequently, we can easily retrieve space- or airborne predictor variables from various rasters (elevation, pH, precipitation, temperature, landcover, soil class, etc.). Subsequently, we model our response as a function of our predictors using lm, glm, gam or a machine-learning technique. To make a spatial prediction, all we have to do, is to apply the estimated coefficients to the predictor rasters, and summing up the resulting output rasters (see also Muenchow et al. (2013)). While local functions operate on one cell, though possibly from multiple layers, focal operations take into account a central cell and its neighbors. The neighborhood (also named kernel, filter or moving window) under consideration is typically of size 3-by-3 cells (that is the central cell and its eight surrounding neighbors) but can take on any other (not necessarily rectangular) shape as defined by the user. A focal operation applies an aggregation function to all cells within the specified neighborhood, uses the corresponding output as the new value for the the central cell, and moves on to the next central cell (Figure 4.10). Other names for this operation are spatial filtering and convolution (Burrough, McDonnell, and Lloyd 2015). In R, we can use the focal() function to perform spatial filtering. We define the shape of the moving window with a matrix whose values correspond to weights. Secondly, the the fun argument lets us specify the function we wish to apply to this neighborhood. Here, we choose the minimum, but of course we can use any other function such as the the sum, the mean, the median, the mode, the maximum or the variance. r_focal = focal(elev, w = matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 3), fun = min) Figure 4.10: Input raster (left) and resulting output raster (right) due to a focal operation - summing up 3-by-3 windows. We can quickly check if the output meets our expectations. In our example, the minimum value has to be always the upper left corner of the moving window (remember we have created the input raster by rowwise incrementing the cell values by one starting at the upper left corner). Of course, the focal()-function has computed the correct result. In this example, our weighting matrix consists only of 1s. This means each cell has the same weight on the output. If appropriate, you can change this by specifying different weights. Focal functions or filters play a dominant role in image processing. Low-pass or smoothing filters use the mean function to remove extremes. In the case of categorical data, we can replace the mean with the mode, which is the most common value. By contrast, high-pass filters accentuate features. The line detection Laplace and Sobel filters might serve as an example here. Check the focal() help page how to use them in R. Also, terrain processing uses heavily focal functions. Think, for instance, of the calculation of the slope, aspect and flow directions. The terrain() function lets you compute a few of these terrain characteristics but has not implemented all popular methods For example, the Zevenbergen and Thorne method to compute the slope is missing. Equally, many other terrain and GIS functions are not implemented in R such as curvatures, contributing areas, different wetness indexes, and many more. Fortunately, desktop GIS commonly provide these algorithms. In Chapter 13 we will learn how to access GIS functionality from within R. Zonal operations are similar to focal operations. The difference is that zonal filters can take on any shape instead of just a predefined window. Our grain size raster is a good example (Figure 3.2) because the different grain sizes are spread in an irregular fashion throughout the raster. To find the mean elevation for each grain size class, we can use the zonal() command. This kind of operation is also known as zonal statistics in the GIS world. z = zonal(elev, grain, fun = &quot;mean&quot;) %&gt;% as.data.frame z #&gt; zone mean #&gt; 1 1 16.8 #&gt; 2 2 19.4 #&gt; 3 3 19.8 This returns the statistics for each category, here the mean altitude for each grain size class. Of course, we can add this statistic to the attribute table of the ratified raster (see previous chapter). Global operations are a special case of zonal operations with the entire raster dataset representing a single zone. The most common global operations are descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset such as the minimum or maximum (see previous chapter). Aside from that, global operations are also useful for the computation of distance and weight rasters. In the first case, one can calculate the distance from each cell to a specific target cell. For example, one might want to compute the distance to the nearest coast (see also raster::distance()). We might also want to consider topography, that means, we are not only interested in the pure distance but would like also to avoid the crossing of mountain ranges when going to the coast. To do so, we can weight the distance with elevation so that each additional altitudinal meter ‘prolongs’ the euclidean distance. Visibility and viewshed computations also belong to the family of global operations . Many map algebra operations have a counterpart in vector processing [Liu and Mason (2009); Table @ref(tab:mapalg_vector))]. Computing a distance raster (zonal operation) while only considering a maximum distance (logical focal operation) is the equivalent to a vector buffer operation (section ??). Reclassifying raster data (either local or zonal function depending on the input) is equivalent to dissolving vector data (section 4.2.3). Overlaying two rasters (local operation), where one contains NULL or NA values representing a mask, is similar to vector clipping (section ??). Quite similar to spatial clipping is intersecting two layers (section 4.2.1). The difference is that two these two layers (vector or raster) simply share an overlapping area (see Figure 4.7 for an example). However, be careful with the wording. Sometimes the same words have slightly different meanings for raster and vector data models. Aggregating in the case of vector data refers to dissolving polygons while it means increasing the resolution in the case of raster data. In fact, one could see dissolving or aggregating polygons as decreasing the resolution. However, zonal operations might be the better raster equivalent compared to changing the cell resolution. Zonal operations can dissolve the cells of one raster in accordance with the zones (categories) of another raster using an aggregation function (see above). 4.3.3 Merging rasters Suppose we would like to compute the NDVI (see focal functions of the previous section), and additionally want to compute terrain attributes from elevation data for observations within a study area. Before such computations we would have to acquire airborne or remotely sensed information. The corresponding imagery is often divided into scenes covering a specific spatial extent. Frequently, a study area covers more than one scene. In these cases we would like to merge the scenes covered by our study area. In the easiest case, we can just merge these scenes, that is put them side to side. This is possible with digital elevation data (SRTM, ASTER). In the following code chunk we first download the SRTM elevation data for Austria and Switzerland (for the country codes have a look at ccodes()). In a second step, we merge the two rasters into one. aut = getData(&quot;alt&quot;, country = &quot;AUT&quot;, mask = TRUE) ch = getData(&quot;alt&quot;, country = &quot;CHE&quot;, mask = TRUE) aut_ch = merge(aut, ch) Raster’s merge() command combines two images, and in case they overlap, it uses the value of the first raster. You can do exactly the same with gdalUtils::mosaic_rasters() which is faster, and therefore recommended if you have to merge a multitude of large rasters stored on disk. The merging approach is of little use when the overlapping values do not correspond to each other. This is frequently the case when you want to combine spectral imagery from scenes that were taken on different dates. The merge() command will still work but you will see a clear border in the resulting image. The mosaic() command lets you define a function for the overlapping area. For instance, we could compute the mean value. This might smooth the clear border in the merged result but it will most likely not make it disappear. To do so, we need a more advanced approach. Remote scientist frequently apply histogram matching or use regression techniques to align the values of the first image with those of the second image. The packages landsat (histmatch(), relnorm(), PIF()), satellite (calcHistMatch()) and RStoolbox (histMatch(), pifMatch()) provide the corresponding functions. 4.3.4 Aligning rasters When merging or performing map algebra on rasters, their resolution, projection, origin and/or extent has to match. Otherwise, how should we add the values of one raster with a resolution of 0.2 decimal degrees to a second with a resolution of 1 decimal degree? The same problem arises when we would like to merge satellite imagery from different sensors with different projections and resolutions. We can deal with such mismatches by aligning the rasters. The projectRaster() function reprojects one raster to a desired projection, say from UTM to WGS84. The origin is the point closest to (0, 0) if you moved towards it in steps of x and y resolution. If two rasters have different origins, their cells do not overlap completely which would make map algebra impossible. To change the origin , use origin().21 Equally, map algebra operations require the same extent. To align the extent of one object with that of another, use the extend() command. If you perform an algebraic operation on two objects with differing extents in R, the raster package returns the intersection, and says so in a warning (try: elev + extend(elev, 2)). The aggregate() and disaggregate() functions help to change the cell size resolution of a raster. For instance let us aggregate elev from a resolution of 0.5 to a resolution of 1, that means we aggregate by a factor of 2. Additionally, the output cell value should correspond to the mean of the input cells (but you can use any other function as well): elev_agg = aggregate(elev, fact = 2, fun = mean) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) plot(elev) plot(elev_agg) Note that the origin of elev_agg has changed, too. The resample() command lets you align several raster properties in one go, namely origin, extent and resolution. Let us resample an extended elev_agg to the properties of elev again. # add 2 rows and columns, i.e. change the extent elev_agg = extend(elev_agg, 2) elev_disagg = resample(elev_agg, elev) Though our disaggregated elev_disagg retrieved back its original resolution, cell size and extent, its values differ. However, this is to be expected, disaggregating cannot predict values at a finer resolution, it simply uses an interpolation algorithm. It is important to keep in mind that disaggregating results in a finer resolution, the corresponding values, however, are only as accurate as their lower resolution source. Finally, if you want to align many (possibly hundreds or thousands of) images stored on disk, you might want to checkout the gdalUtils::align_rasters() function. Nevertheless, you may also use raster with very large datasets. This is because raster: lets you work with raster datasets that are too large to fit into the main memory (RAM) by only processing chunks of it. tries to fascilitate parallel processing. For more information have a look at the help pages of beginCluster() and clusteR(). Additionally, check out the Multi-core functions section in vignette(&quot;functions&quot;, package = &quot;raster&quot;). 4.4 Exercises Write code that subsets points that are contained within x and y (illustrated by the plot in the 2nd row and the 1st column in Figure 4.7). Create a randomly located point with the command st_point() (refer back to section 2.1.4.2 to see how to create spatial data ‘from scratch’). Write code that uses functions aggregate() and st_buffer() to answers the following question: What proportion of the world’s population lives in countries that intersect a circle with a 10 degree radius of the intersection between the equator and the 9th meridian?

This post shows how to compute distances to the nearest coastline using raster::distance(). Retrieve a digital elevation model of Spain, and compute a raster which represents the distance to the coast. (Hint: Have a look at getData() to retrieve a digital elevation model and administrative boundaries for Spain.) Before, computing the distance raster, you might want to increase the resolution of the input dem raster, otherwise computing time might become too long. Secondly, weight the distance raster with elevation. Every 100 altitudinal meters should increase the distance to the coast by 10 km. Finally, compute the difference between the raster using the euclidean distance and the raster weighted by elevation. (Note that this is a very simple weighting approach. A more advanced approach might instead weight by flow direction, i.e. favor the steepest drop or the slightest increase in elevation.) References "],

This chapter is about getting spatial data onto your computer and then, perhaps after processing it with techniques described in this book, back out to the world. Before we can even think about processing data, we need to retrieve it, i.e. we need to know which sources are at our disposal (section @{#retrieving-data}). Having data, we need to know how we can import them in our software. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the most often used spatial file formats and their pros and cons (see section 5.3). For the same purposes knowing how to efficiently read and write spatial data is crucial (see sections 5.4 and 5.5). We also include a section (5.6) on visualization because outputting data in a human (not just computer) readable format enables non-programmers to benefit from your work. I/O is short for “input/output” which means, in plain English, “reading and writing data”. We use the acronym instead of plain English not to confuse you or to make chapter names short, but because that is the term used in computer science, and it is useful to think of data import and export from a computing perspective.22 5.2 Retrieving open data Nowadays, a vast amount of spatial data is available on the internet. Best of all, much of it is freely available. You just have to know where to look. While we cannot provide a comprehensive guide to all available geodata, we point to a few of the most important sources. Overall, geolibraries and geoportals facilitate the search and download of geodata. Geolibraries are a very useful data source but often only contain data for a specific locations. Then the might struggle to find the exact geolibrary matching his or her demands. Here, geolibraries come to the rescue bundling the information of a collection of geolibraries. If you are looking for data from all over the world, the GEOSS portal might be a good starting point. We also would like you to point to the EarthExplorer and the Copernicus Open Access Hub for a wide variety of global datasets including multispectral and radar images. European data is available from the Initiative for spatial information in the European Community ([INSPIRE][http://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/)). This Wikipedia article lists a few more interesting geoportals. Typically, geoportals provide an interface that lets you query interactively the existing data (spatial and temporal extent, and product). However, in this book we encourage you to create reproducible workflows. Automated data downloads are often possible through simple download calls or specific APIs (e.g., have a look at the Sentinel API), which saves human working time, and allows to easily repeat and update this process in the future. Traditionally, files have been stored on servers. You can easily download such files with the download.file() command. For example, to download National Park Service units in the United States, run: url = file.path(&quot;http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com&quot;, &quot;download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_parks_and_protected_lands.zip&quot;) download.file(url = url, destfile = &quot;USA_parks.zip&quot;) unzip(zipfile = &quot;USA_parks.zip&quot;) usa_parks = st_read(&quot;ne_10m_parks_and_protected_lands_area.shp&quot;) Specific R packages providing an interface to geolibraries or geoportals are even more user-friendly (Table 5.1). Table 5.1: Selected R packages for spatial data retrieval Package name Description osmdata Download and import of OpenStreetMap data. raster The getData() function downloads and imports administrative country, SRTM/ASTER elevation, WorldClim data. rnaturalearth Functions to download Natural Earth vector and raster data, including world country borders. rnoaa An R interface to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate data. rWBclimate An access to the World Bank climate data. For example, you can get the borders of any country with the ne_countries() function from the rnaturalearth package: library(rnaturalearth) usa = ne_countries(country = &quot;United States of America&quot;) # United States borders class(usa) #&gt; [1] &quot;SpatialPolygonsDataFrame&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;package&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;sp&quot; # you can do the same with raster::getData() # getData(&quot;GADM&quot;, country = &quot;USA&quot;, level = 0) As a default, rnaturalearth returns the output as a Spatial* class. You can easily convert it to the sf class with st_as_sf(): usa_sf = st_as_sf(usa) As a second example, we will download a raster dataset. The code below downloads a series of rasters that contains global monthly precipitation sums. The spatial resoultion is ten minutes. The result is a multilayer object of class RasterStack. library(raster) worldclim_prec = getData(name = &quot;worldclim&quot;, var = &quot;prec&quot;, res = 10) class(worldclim_prec) #&gt; [1] &quot;RasterStack&quot; #&gt; attr(,&quot;package&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;raster&quot; Finally, R packages might contain or just consist of spatial data (e.g., package spData). You can access such data with the data() function. For example, you can get a list of dataset in a package, data(package = &quot;spData&quot;). To attach the dataset to the global environment specify the name of a dataset (data(&quot;cycle_hire&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;)). Sometimes, packages come also with the original files.23. To load such a file from the package, you need to specify the package name and the relative path to the dataset, for example: world_raw_filepath = system.file(&quot;shapes/world.gpkg&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;) world_raw = st_read(world_raw_filepath) #&gt; Reading layer `wrld.gpkg&#39; from data source `/home/travis/R/Library/spData/shapes/world.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; #&gt; Simple feature collection with 177 features and 10 fields #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: -180 ymin: -90 xmax: 180 ymax: 83.64513 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs Find more information on getting data using R packages in section 5.5 and section 5.6 of Gillespie and Lovelace (2016). 5.3 File formats Spatial data is usually stored as files or in geodatabases. File-based data formats can contain either vector or raster data, while geodatabases could store both. Historically, GIS file formats were developed by mapping agencies and software companies. Exchanging spatial data between different software packages each coming with its own format was troublesome in the beginning. GDAL24put an end to these troubles by enabling reading and writing many raster and vector data formats. Subsequently, many open and proprietary GIS software (e.g., GRASS, QGIS, ArcGIS, ENVI) were quick to incorporate it. Another change for spatial data formats came with the foundation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)25. This organization collaborates on the development and implementation of open standards for geospatial content including file formats such as the KML and GeoPackage formats as well as the simple feature standard. Developing and maintaining spatial file formats in an open model provides several benefits over the proprietary formats , and eases interoperability. Nowadays, more than a hundred spatial data formats exist. Table 5.2 presents some basic information about selected, often used spatial file formats. Table 5.2: Selected spatial file formats. Name Extension Info Type Model ESRI Shapefile .shp (the main file) One of the most popular vector file format. Consists of at least three files. The main files size cannot exceed 2 GB. It lacks support for mixed type. Columns names are limited to 10 characters, and number of columns are limited at 255. It has poor support for Unicode standard. Vector Partially open GeoJSON .geojson Extends the JSON exchange format by including a subset of the simple feature representation. Vector Open KML .kml XML-based format for spatial visualization, developed for use with Google Earth. Zipped KML file forms the KMZ format. Vector Open GPX .gpx XML schema created for exchange of GPS data. Vector Open GeoTIFF .tiff GeoTIFF is one of the most popular raster formats. Its structure is similar to the regular .tif format, however, additionally stores the raster header. Raster Open Arc ASCII .asc Text format where the first six lines represent the raster header, followed by the raster cell values arranged in rows and columns. Raster Open R-raster .gri, .grd Native raster format of the R-package raster. Raster Open SQLite/SpatiaLite .sqlite SQLite is a standalone, relational database management system. It is used as a default database driver in GRASS GIS 7. SpatiaLite is the spatial extension of SQLite providing support for simple features. Vector and raster Open ESRI FileGDB .gdb Collection of spatial and nonspatial objects created in the ArcGIS software. It allows to store multiple feature classes and enables use of topological definitions. Limited access to this format is provided by GDAL with the use of the OpenFileGDB and FileGDB drivers. Vector and raster Proprietary GeoPackage .gpkg Lightweight database container based on SQLite allowing an easy and platform-independent exchange of geodata Vector and raster Open 5.4 Data Input (I) Executing commands such as sf::st_read() (the main function we use for loading vector data) or raster::raster() (the main function used for loading raster data) silently sets off a chain of events that reads data from files. Moreover, there are many R packages containing a wide range of spatial data or providing simple access to different data sources. All of them load the data into R or, more precisely, assign objects to your workspace, stored in RAM accessible from the .GlobalEnv26 of your current R session. 5.4.1 Vector data Spatial vector data comes in a wide variety of file formats, most of which can be read-in via the sf function st_read(). Behind the scenes this calls GDAL. To find out which data formats sf supports, run st_drivers(). Here, we show only the first two drivers (see Table 5.3): sf_drivers = st_drivers() head(sf_drivers, n = 2) Table 5.3: Sample of available drivers for reading/writing vector data (it could vary between different GDAL versions). name long_name write copy is_raster is_vector ESRI Shapefile ESRI Shapefile TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE GPX GPX TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE KML Keyhole Markup Language (KML) TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE GeoJSON GeoJSON TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE GPKG GeoPackage TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE The first argument of st_read() is dsn, which should be a text string or an object containing a single text string. The content of a text string could vary between different drivers. In most cases, as with the ESRI Shapefile (.shp) or the GeoPackage format (.gpkg), the dsn would be a file name. st_read() guesses the driver based on the file extension, as illustrated for a .gpkg file below: library(sf) vector_filepath = system.file(&quot;shapes/world.gpkg&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;) world = st_read(vector_filepath) #&gt; Reading layer `wrld.gpkg&#39; from data source `/home/travis/R/Library/spData/shapes/world.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; #&gt; Simple feature collection with 177 features and 10 fields #&gt; geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON #&gt; dimension: XY #&gt; bbox: xmin: -180 ymin: -90 xmax: 180 ymax: 83.64513 #&gt; epsg (SRID): 4326 #&gt; proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs For some drivers, dsn could be provided as a folder name, access credentials for a database, or a GeoJSON string representation (see the examples of the st_read() help page for more details). Some vector driver formats can store multiple data layers. By default, st_read automatically reads the first layer of the file specified in dsn, however, using the layer argument you can specify any other layer. Naturally, some options are specific to certain drivers27. For example, think of coordinates stored in a spreadsheet format (.csv). To read in such files as spatial objects, we naturally have to specify the names of the columns (X and Y in our example below) representing the coordinates. We can do this with the help of the options parameter. To find out about possible options, please refer to the ‘Open Options’ section of the corresponding GDAL driver description. For the comma-separated value (csv) format, visit http://www.gdal.org/drv_csv.html. cycle_hire_txt = system.file(&quot;misc/cycle_hire_xy.csv&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;) cycle_hire_xy = st_read(cycle_hire_txt, options = c(&quot;X_POSSIBLE_NAMES=X&quot;, &quot;Y_POSSIBLE_NAMES=Y&quot;)) Instead of columns describing xy-coordinates, a single column can also contain the geometry information. Well-known text (WKT), well-known binary (WKB), and the GeoJSON formats are examples for this. For instance, the world_wkt.csv file has a column named WKT representing polygons of the world’s countries. We will again use the options parameter to indicate this. Here, we will use read_sf() which does exactly the same as st_read() except it does not print the driver name to the console and stores strings as characters instead of factors. world_txt = system.file(&quot;misc/world_wkt.csv&quot;, package = &quot;spData&quot;) world_wkt = read_sf(world_txt, options = &quot;GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=WKT&quot;) # the same as world_wkt = st_read(world_txt, options = &quot;GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=WKT&quot;, quiet = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) Not all of the supported vector file formats store information about their coordinate reference system. In these situations, it is possible to add the missing information using the st_set_crs() function. Please refer also to section 2.3 for more information. 5.4.2 Raster data Similar to vector data, raster data comes in many file formats with some of them supporting even multilayer files. raster’s raster() command reads in a single layer. library(raster) library(spDataLarge) raster_filepath = system.file(&quot;raster/srtm.tif&quot;, package = &quot;spDataLarge&quot;) single_layer = raster(raster_filepath) In case you want to read in a single band from a multilayer file use the band parameter to indicate a specific layer. multilayer_filepath = system.file(&quot;raster/landsat.tif&quot;, package = &quot;spDataLarge&quot;) band3 = raster(multilayer_filepath, band = 3) If you want to read in all bands, use brick() or stack(). multilayer_brick = brick(multilayer_filepath) multilayer_stack = stack(multilayer_filepath) Please refer to section 2.2.3 for information on the difference between raster stacks and bricks. 5.5 Data output (O) The ability of writing spatial data could be used for conversion between different formats and for saving newly created objects. Depending on the data type (vector or raster), object class (e.g multipoint or RasterLayer), and type and amount of stored information (e.g. object size, range of values) - it is important to know how to store spatial files in the most efficient way. The next two section will show how to do that. 5.5.1 Vector data The counterpart of st_read() is st_write(). It allows to write sf objects to a wide range of geographic vector file formats, including the most common ones such as .geojson, .shp and .gpkg. Based on the file name, st_write() decides automatically which driver to use. How fast the writing process is depends also on the driver. st_write(obj = world, dsn = &quot;world.gpkg&quot;) #&gt; Writing layer `world&#39; to data source `world.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; #&gt; features: 177 #&gt; fields: 10 #&gt; geometry type: Multi Polygon Note: if you try to write to the same data source again, the function will fail: st_write(obj = world, dsn = &quot;world.gpkg&quot;) #&gt; Updating layer `world&#39; to data source `/home/travis/build/Robinlovelace/geocompr/world.gpkg&#39; using driver `GPKG&#39; #&gt; Warning in CPL_write_ogr(obj, dsn, layer, driver, as.character(dataset_options), : GDAL Error 1: Layer world already exists, CreateLayer failed. #&gt; Use the layer creation option OVERWRITE=YES to replace it. #&gt; Creating layer world failed. #&gt; Error in CPL_write_ogr(obj, dsn, layer, driver, as.character(dataset_options), : Layer creation failed. The error message provides some information as to why the function failed. The GDAL Error 1 statement makes clear that the failure occurred at the GDAL level. Additionally, the suggestion to use OVERWRITE=YES provides a clue how to fix the problem. However, this is not a st_write() argument, it is a GDAL option. Luckily, st_write provides a layer_options argument through which we can pass driver-dependent options: st_write(obj = world, dsn = &quot;world.gpkg&quot;, layer_options = &quot;OVERWRITE=YES&quot;) Another solution is to use the st_write() argument delete_layer. Setting it to TRUE deletes already existing layers in the data source before the function attempts to write (note there is also a delete_dsn argument): st_write(obj = world, dsn = &quot;world.gpkg&quot;, delete_layer = TRUE) You can achieve the same with write_sf() since it is equivalent to (technically an alias for) st_write(), except that its defaults for delete_layer and quiet is TRUE. write_sf(obj = world, dsn = &quot;world.gpkg&quot;) The layer_options argument could be also used for many different purposes. One of them is to write spatial data to a text file. This can be done by specifying GEOMETRY inside of layer_options. It could be either AS_XY for simple point datasets (it creates two new columns for coordinates) or AS_WKT for more complex spatial data (one new column is created which contains the well-known-text representation of spatial objects). library(spData) st_write(cycle_hire_xy, &quot;cycle_hire_xy.csv&quot;, layer_options = &quot;GEOMETRY=AS_XY&quot;) st_write(world_wkt, &quot;world_wkt.csv&quot;, layer_options = &quot;GEOMETRY=AS_WKT&quot;) 5.5.2 Raster data The writeRaster() function saves Raster* objects to files on disk. The function expects input regarding output datatype, file format, but also accepts GDAL options specific to a selected file format (see ?writeRaster for more details). The raster package offers nine datatypes when saving a raster: LOG1S, INT1S, INT1U, INT2S, INT2U, INT4S, INT4U, FLT4S, and FLT8S28. The datatype determines the bit representation of the raster object written to disk (5.4). Which datatype to use depends on the range of the values of your raster object. The more values a datatype can represent, the larger the file will get on disk. Commonly, one would use LOG1S for bitmap (binary) rasters. Unsigned integers (INT1U, INT2U, INT4U) are suitable for categorical data, while float numbers (FLT4S and FLTS8S) usually represent continuous data. writeRaster() uses FLT4S as the default. While this works in most cases, the size of the output file will be unnecessarly large if you save binary or categorical data. Therefore, we would recommend to use the datatype that needs the least storing space but is still able to represent all values (check the range of values with the summary() function). Table 5.4: Datatypes supported by the raster package Datatype Minimum value Maximum value LOG1S FALSE (0) TRUE (1) INT1S -127 127 INT1U 0 255 INT2S -32,767 32,767 INT2U 0 65,534 INT4S -2,147,483,647 2,147,483,647 INT4U 0 4,294,967,296 FLT4S -3.4e+38 3.4e+38 FLT8S -1.7e+308 1.7e+308 The file extension determines the output file when saving a Raster* object to disk. For example, the .tif extension will create a GeoTIFF file: writeRaster(x = single_layer, filename = &quot;my_raster.tif&quot;, datatype = &quot;INT2U&quot;) The raster file format (native to the raster package) is used when a file extension is invalid or missing. Some raster file formats come with additional options. You can use them with the options parameter29. For example, GeoTIFF allows to compress the output raster with the COMPRESS option30: writeRaster(x = single_layer, filename = &quot;my_raster.tif&quot;, datatype = &quot;INT2U&quot;, options = c(&quot;COMPRESS=DEFLATE&quot;), overwrite = TRUE) Note that writeFormats() returns a list with all supported file formats on your computer. 5.6 Visual outputs R supports many different static and interactive graphics formats. The most general method to save a static plot is to open a graphic device, create a plot, and close it, for example: png(filename = &quot;lifeExp.png&quot;, width = 500, height = 350) plot(world[&quot;lifeExp&quot;]) dev.off() Other available graphic devices include pdf(), bmp(), jpeg(), png(), and tiff(). You can specify several properties of the output plot, including width, height and resolution. Additionally, several graphic packages provide its own function to save a graphical output. For example, the tmap package has the save_tmap() function. You can save a tmap object to different graphic formats by specifying the object name and a file path to a new graphic file. library(tmap) tmap_obj = tm_shape(world) + tm_polygons(col = &quot;lifeExp&quot;) save_tmap(tm = tmap_obj, filename = &quot;lifeExp_tmap.png&quot;) On the other hand, on can save interactive maps as an HTML file using the saveWidget() function from the htmlwidgets package: library(mapview) library(htmlwidgets) mapview_obj = mapview(world, zcol = &quot;lifeExp&quot;, legend = TRUE) saveWidget(mapview_obj, file = &quot;my_interactive_map.html&quot;) 5.7 Exercises List and describe three types of vector, raster, and geodatabase formats. Name at least two differences between read_sf() and the more well-known function st_read(). Read the cycle_hire_xy.csv file from the spData package (Hint: it is located in the misc\\ folder). What is a geometry type of the loaded object? Download the borders of Germany using rnaturalearth, and create a new object called germany_borders. Write this new object to a file of the GeoPackage format. Download the global monthly minimum temperature with a spatial resolution of five minutes using the raster package. Extract the June values, and save them to a file named tmin_june.tif file (Hint: use raster::subset()). Create a static map of Germany’s borders, and save it to a PNG file. Create an interactive map using data from the cycle_hire_xy.csv file. Export this map to a file called cycle_hire.html. References "],
